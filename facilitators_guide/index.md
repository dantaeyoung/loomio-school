# The Facilitator's Guide to Loomio üê∫

 **What if we started from facilitation principles and worked toward understanding the tool?**

Loomio is made by facilitators, and that plays a huge role in how the tool has been designed. This guide is about revealing more of that context.

## More about this guide

Whether employed by a professional facilitator, people peer-facilitating each other, or a group that has no awareness of facilitation at all, Loomio‚Äôs essential function is to mediate and support group communication toward a desired outcome. This is facilitation. 

Loomio is *groupware*:

> Collaborative software, or groupware, is designed to help people involved in a common task achieve their goals. One of the earliest definitions of collaborative software is 'intentional group processes plus software to support them.'
 

There is a huge body of knowledge, best practice, and tradition in both in-person facilitation and online moderation - but the art and science of their intersection is only just emerging. This is the specific space in which Loomio strives to be.

## About the author

Hi! I'm Alanna.

<a href="alanna_fringe_s.jpg" alt="Alanna"><img src="alanna_fringe_s.jpg" class="img-left img-50pc"/></a>

I'm one of the founders of Loomio, and I've been thinking deeply about how it works from a facilitation perspective from the beginning. I am not a seminal facilitation expert; I consider myself only a beginner in this craft that one could spend a lifetime honing. 

What I can offer is help translating between the offline and online spaces, as a practitioner in both. I've also facilitated a lot of groups who use Loomio. 

You can find out [more about me on my website](http://alanna.space).

I'm only one person, with one perspective and approach to facilitation, when there are myriad approaches. I've tried to bring in a couple other facilitator's voices here, including [Rich](http://richdecibels.com/) from Loomio and Silvia from [EXP](http://exp.agency). You'll see their words scattered throughout.
