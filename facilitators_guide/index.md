# The Facilitator's Guide to Loomio üê∫

If we begin thinking from facilitation first principles and best practice, and interpret it in the Loomio context of an online tool, what can we learn?


Whether it‚Äôs being employed by a professional facilitator explicitly in that role, or people peer-facilitating each other, or a group that has no awareness of facilitation at all, Loomio‚Äôs essential function is to mediate and support group communication and interaction toward a desired outcome. This is facilitation. 


Loomio is groupware. This is a term with a specific meaning:
Collaborative software or groupware is an application software designed to help people involved in a common task to achieve their goals. One of the earliest definitions of collaborative software is 'intentional group processes plus software to support them.'


Groupware is essentially about interpreting facilitation into software. This is the heart of what we‚Äôre here to do with Loomio. We need to understand our product‚Äôs identity as groupware, and think deeply about the intersection of traditional facilitation - what we can learn from generations who have come before us - and emerging future possibilities enabled by communication in the online space.


There is a huge body of knowledge, best practice, and tradition in both in-person facilitation and online moderation - but the art and science of their intersection is only just emerging. This is the specific space in which Loomio should work to be a world class product.

I am not a seminal facilitation expert. I consider myself only a beginner, in a craft which one can spend a lifetime honing. I am also only one person with one perspective and approach to facilitation. I do not claim to be any kind of definitive source. What I can offer is help translating between the offline and online spaces, as a practitioner in both. 


If I am making an argument here, it‚Äôs that giving users what they think they want, what feels ‚Äúeasiest‚Äù to them, is not the whole story of providing value. If people already knew exactly what to do, they would not need our help. They are looking to us to provide a certain level of guidance, a certain degree of opinionatedness in the experience we invite them into. In other words, to facilitate them.
