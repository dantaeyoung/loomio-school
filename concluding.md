## Outcomes & Next Steps

Confirming the outcome can be a critical aspect of feeling like the goals of a collaborative discussion have been achieved. A facilitator can pull together what’s been said or decided and reflect it back, to help the group walk away with a shared understanding.

Participants want to walk away feeling like they have the answers to some key questions: What did we do? What does it mean? What will happen now? What is my piece or responsibility? What will be different because we went through this experience? Sometimes the answers to these questions are very concrete, such as action points, while other times they are more abstract, such as deepening shared understanding.

### Translating this into Loomio

* Decision outcome statements are a very important tool. A proposal ending is not quite the end: there’s a need to sum up the meaning of the outcome conclusively. That's what the outcome feature is for.
* Many Loomio discussions come to a natural end without even using proposals or publishing outcomes. These discussions still provide a lot of value.


## Reporting & Harvesting

To understand the meaning of an experience, you have to inquire into how it fits into the bigger context. What was this moment, in the bigger rhythm of our progress? What form will our understanding from this experience take - a story? a report? a change? a call to action?

Reporting and harvesting are an important function of facilitation, because the experience happens in the moment, but its impact often comes from putting handles on it, giving it a name, and being able to use it in other contexts and refer to it usefully. Some experiences are meant to happen in an instant and then be let go - but most productive collaboration is helped by a tangible harvest, documentation, or reporting.

### Translating this into Loomio

* One of Loomio’s least talked about and most valuable features is that it is self-documenting - notes write themselves as an integrated part of the process. This creates a gold-mine of archival content for groups, without any extra effort.
* We have some features to support harvesting and archiving specifically, such as the ‘previous decisions’ list, and the print discussion option (which can also be used to export as PDF).
* Search is an important aspect of Loomio harvesting. It’s probably the first way people attempt to locate past discussions to make use of them.
* Many groups use Loomio to smoothly integrate content from various channels - for example, the workflow of posting a meeting announcement and building and agenda on Loomio, having the meeting in person, posting the notes back on Loomio, and making related decisions in that same thread. This expands the "self-harvesting" ability of Loomio beyond the online space, while usefully integrating it into a single archive.


## Turning Discussion into Action

There comes a moment when the outcomes of a facilitated collaboration space have to re-engage with the reality outside that room. Occasionally the need is simply to work with ideas and feelings, without worrying about implementation, but usually a group will not reach its goals without applying its decisions and conceptual conclusions to real-world action. This transition is part of the total facilitated experience.

It’s at this point that a collaborative process intersects with other systems of the group or organisation, and the facilitator has to help figure out how it can be weaved in. These other systems might include:

* **Power** - who actually makes decisions, what has to happen for ideas to turn into reality in the political/social/organisational structure?
* **Management** - How does this work fit into other work or priorities? What dependencies might exist that need to be understood?
* **Delegation** - Who will take responsibility for next steps and actions? Will they be held accountable?
* **Communication** - How will what’s happened in this process or discussion be relayed to others? What do they need to know?

If there are any blocks around these issues, it can be damaging to leave this realisation until the moment of conclusion. For example, if the participants don’t actually have the power to make a change they have decided, they will feel defeated. It can be advisable to think ahead toward how conclusions could be made into reality when setting up the process in the first place, and scoping the collaboration to the circumstances.


### Translating this into Loomio

* Use Loomio features to clarify things like who will take what action out of a decision. This happens in ‘manual’ ways like stating a person’s name or a date in a comment or outcome statement.
* Many users accomplish integrating Loomio content into other organisational systems through other channels like reviewing Loomio decision in offline meetings, or transferring outcomes to Trello cards.
* The design of Loomio helps people to determine what needs to happen to turn a discussion into action, even if there’s no specific feature around a function - for example, making a decision naturally leads people to ask, "OK, but how are we going to take this forward?"


## It Ain’t Over Til It’s Over

Ending well is important. Sometimes the end is determined by running out of time, and sometimes it’s when certain goals are achieved. There’s a ritual to closing a process, and if it’s missed people will feel unsettled. It’s important to recognise implicit and explicit cues indicating if the individuals, and the group as a whole, can feel completion of a process or phase.

Participants often look to the leader or facilitator for confirmation of when it’s actually over, and it usually pays to be explicit about it. Sometimes the signal is a clear statement that the session is wrapping up, a recap of decisions or next steps, and bidding everyone goodbye. Other times groups have established practices like a check-out or a clap.

### Translating this into Loomio

* The clearest indication of conclusion we have is publishing a decision outcome.
* Some groups make use of Thread Archive subgroups to move old discussions to.
* Deactivating a group is the strongest possible ‘closure’ move in Loomio currently.
* Make a point of celebrating milestones
