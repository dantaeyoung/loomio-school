# Concluding

## Outcomes & Next Steps

Confirming the outcome can be a critical aspect of feeling like the goals collaborative discussion have been achieved. A facilitator can pull together what’s been said or decided and reflect it back, to help the group walk away with a shared understanding. 

Participants want to walk away feeling like they have the answers to some key questions: What did we do? What does it mean? What will happen now? What is my piece or responsibility? What will be different because we went through this experience? Sometimes the answers to these questions are very concrete, such as action points, while other times they are more abstract, such as deepening shared understanding.

Existing Loomio:

* Decision outcome statements are a very important tool. We’ve correctly seen that a proposal ending is not quite the end, and there’s a need to sum up the meaning of the outcome conclusively.

* Many Loomio discussions come to a natural end without even using proposals or publishing outcomes. These discussions still provide a lot of value.

Areas for Research:

* Could we be doing more with the Outcomes feature, or doing a better job encouraging people to use it? 

* How do we understand, support, and design for discussions which end without using some of the "concluding" functions like proposals and outcomes? Could we help users get more value out of understanding conclusions from their discussions anyway?

## Reporting & Harvesting

To understand the meaning of an experience, you have to inquire into how it fits into the bigger context. What was this moment, in the bigger rhythm of our progress? What form will our understanding from this experience take - a story? a report? a change? a call to action?

Reporting and harvesting are an important function of facilitation, because the experience happens in the moment, but its impact often comes from putting handles on it, giving it a name, and being able to use it in other contexts and refer to it usefully. Some experiences are meant to happen in an instant and then be let go - but most productive collaboration is helped by a tangible harvest, documentation, or reporting.

Existing Loomio:

* One of Loomio’s least talked about and most valuable features is that it is self-documenting - notes write themselves as an integrated part of the process. This creates a gold-mine of archival content for groups, without any extra effort.

* We have some features to support harvesting and archiving specifically, such as the ‘previous decisions’ list, and the export/print discussion option. 

* Search is an important aspect of Loomio harvesting. It’s probably the first way people attempt to locate past discussions to make use of them.

* Many groups use Loomio to smoothly integrate content from various channels - for example, the workflow of posting a meeting announcement and building and agenda on Loomio, having the meeting in person, posting the notes back on Loomio, and making related decisions in that same thread. This expands the "self-harvesting" ability of Loomio beyond the online space, while usefully integrating it into a single archive.

Areas for Research:

* Could we pay more attention to and improve the previous decisions and search features, to make a group’s Loomio archive more useful and its value more apparent?

* Are our discussion export functions serving the need to create reports well enough? What do groups need to turn a Loomio decision into a piece of content that can be employed in other contexts, like a building block?

* How can we skillfully enable both privacy and transparency, to help groups feel confident communicating their Loomio content? We have various privacy settings, but no features specifically around supporting reporting out more widely than the members of a private group.

* Many organisations aspire to transparency, but don’t put it into practice due to practical concerns - could Loomio make good transparency easier, working alongside its powerful ability to passively capture content? How can people share some content, instead of just all or nothing? How can they use Loomio content to craft a story or report?

* Users could probably get a lot of value from referring back to older discussions that they are not currently getting, because interacting with a Loomio archive is not a smooth experience. Could we help users to re-open old discussions on a topic instead of starting new ones, by letting them know the old discussion exists? Could we help people set reminders to refer back to discussions at a point in the future?

## Turning Discussion into Action

There comes a moment when the outcomes of a facilitated collaboration space have to re-engage with the reality outside that room. Occasionally the need is simply to work with ideas and feelings, without worrying about implementation, but usually a group will not reach its goals without applying its decisions and conceptual conclusions to real-world action. This transition is part of the total facilitated experience.

It’s at this point that a collaborative process intersects with other systems of the group or organisation, and the facilitator has to help figure out how it can be weaved in. These other systems might include:

* Power - who actually makes decisions, what has to happen for ideas to turn into reality in the political/social/organisational structure?

* Management - How does this work fit into other work or priorities? What dependencies might exist that need to be understood? 

* Delegation - Who will take responsibility for next steps and actions? Will they be held accountable?

* Communication - How will what’s happened in this process or discussion be relayed to others? What do they need to know?

If there are any blocks around these issues, it can be damaging to leave this realisation until the moment of conclusion. For example, if the participants don’t actually have the power to make a change they have decided, they will feel defeated. It can be advisable to think ahead toward how conclusions could be made into reality when setting up the process in the first place, and scoping the collaboration to the circumstances.

Existing Loomio:

* Users already employ Loomio features to clarify things like who will take what action out of a decision. This happens in ‘manual’ ways like stating a person’s name or a date in a comment or outcome statement.

* Many users accomplish integrating Loomio content into other organisational systems through other channels like reviewing Loomio decision in offline meetings, or transferring outcomes to Trello cards.

* The design of Loomio helps people to determine what needs to happen to turn a discussion into action, even if there’s no specific feature around a function - for example, making a decision naturally leads people to ask, "OK, but how are we going to take this forward?"

Areas for Research:

* We have created space for the "what" and “why” of outcome statements, but not the “who” or the “when” - could we enable tagging users or putting in dates for follow-up as well, to encourage clear action-oriented next steps when appropriate?

* Could Loomio integrate with other task tracking or project management tools?

* The decision archive could function as a useful reference of commitments or delegations, if improved in design.

* Better search functionality could help groups use their Loomio content as a better record of actions and commitments.

* Could we do more to encourage people to come back to previous decisions, and update them with what happened, to tie the conversation more to the real world outcomes?

* Should we be doing more at the early set-up phase of discussions and groups, to help users be more successful when they get to the point of implementing what they’ve decided?

## It Ain’t Over Til It’s Over

Ending well is important. Sometimes the end is determined by running out of time, and sometimes it’s when certain goals are achieved. There’s a ritual to closing a process, and if it’s missed people will feel unsettled. It’s important to recognise implicit and explicit cues indicating if the individuals, and the group as a whole, can feel completion of a process or phase.

Participants often look to the leader or facilitator for confirmation of when it’s actually over, and it usually pays to be explicit about it. Sometimes the signal is a clear statement that the session is wrapping up, a recap of decisions or next steps, and bidding everyone goodbye. Other times groups have established practices like a check-out or a clap.

Existing Loomio:

* The clearest indication of conclusion we have is probably publishing a decision outcome.

* Some groups make use of Thread Archive subgroups to move old discussions to.

* Deactivating a group is the strongest possible ‘closure’ move in Loomio currently.

Area for Research:

* Could we be doing more to encourage use of decision outcomes? Could we prompt for them when they aren’t used? What makes for a good outcomes statement?

* Some users have requested features around closing or archiving discussions. This indicates a need for better tools to create closure. At the same time, re-opening old discussions can lead to very rich continued collaboration at a later date, so it’s important we don’t push users to close things off too strictly.

* Should deactivating a group trigger some kind of message to users? Currently it happens silently. 

* How can we celebrate or help users complete a process?
