# Joining your first Loomio group

If you're not sure what Loomio is, check out [overview](overview.md) first.

If you've just been invited to a group and want to know things you can do to help it be a sucessful and nice place to be. Follow the tips below.

## Add a profile photo
Reading text on a screen can be a bit impersonal. Make things friendlier by adding a profile photo to give a face to your name.

## Choose email settings that work for you.
  What's your preference? *stub*

## Check if anyone is missing
Check the members list on your Loomio group page. Are people missing? Maybe give them a phone call or an email to make sure they’ve got their invitation.

## Say "Hello"
There’s a thread in your group where you can introduce yourself. What part of your background is relevant to this group? What do you want to achieve together?

## Share relevant information: you can post links to other online content, or attach files and pictures to your comments.

## Think of others
Bring people into the discussion by mentioning them: type “@” followed by their name to let them know you’re looking for their input.

## Stay on topic
if you notice that you are writing a comment that isn’t about the topic of the thread, but is about something else... start a new thread!

## Be concise
Summarise your thoughts into a paragraph or two. Long comments can be hard to follow.

## Keep the title and context up to date
Make it easy for people to catch up by updating the thread context and title with concise information as the discussion progresses. *link to help*

## Help maintain the vibe!
Be expressive! Use emojis (click the smiley face in the Add a Comment box) to add colour, fun, and extra meaning to your comments.
Be positive. Thank people. And use emojis. Respect difference, it's where the good stuff is when you work together.

So you've been invited to a loomio group.

Here's what I'd love to tell everyone who joins a loomio group.


Find your comfortable notification email settings.
  I recommend you use the daily digest and mention emails.
  but you might want blow by blow or just mentions.


Respond to things within a day.
  Or sometimes in 3 days. If you want, take your time to reply.
  Most of the time, You should expect to see a reply by the next day.

Participate.

Bring information into the discussion.

Rename titles and update context onbehalf of the thread.

Notice if people have not participated and mention them if you would like to hear them in the conversation.


Be positive. eg: "Great correction! That's a much better way to do it."
Equire "Can you clarify what you mean?"
