# Tips for participating in a Loomio group.

If you don't know anything about Loomio, check out [overview](overview.md) first.

If you've just been invited to a group and want to know things you can do to help it be a sucessful and nice place to be. Follow the tips below.

üíÖ Add a profile photo
Reading text on a screen can be a bit impersonal. Make things friendlier by adding a profile photo to give a face to your name.

  Configure your email settings.
  What's your preference? *stub*

üëâ Check if anyone is missing
Check the members list on your Loomio group page. Are people missing? Maybe give them a phone call or an email to make sure they‚Äôve got their invitation.

üé§ Introduce yourself
There‚Äôs a discussion thread in your group where you can introduce yourself. What part of your background is relevant to this group? What do you want to achieve together?

  Share relevant information: you can post links to other online content, or attach files and pictures to your comments.

  Bring people into the discussion by mentioning them: type ‚Äú@‚Äù followed by their name to let them know you‚Äôre looking for their input.

  Stay on topic: if you notice that you are writing a comment that isn‚Äôt about the topic of the thread, but is about something else... start a new thread!

  Be concise: summarise your thoughts into a paragraph or two. Long comments can be hard to follow.

  Keep the thread up to date: make it easy for people to catch up by updating the thread context and title as the discussion progresses. *link to help*

  Be expressive! Use emojis (click the smiley face in the Add a Comment box) to add colour, fun, and extra meaning to your comments.
  Be positive. Thank people. And use emojis. Respect difference, it's where the good stuff is when you work together.
