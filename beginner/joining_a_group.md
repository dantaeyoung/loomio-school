# Joining your first Loomio group

If you're not sure what Loomio is, check out ["What is Loomio?"](overview.md) first.

Someone has invited you to join a Loomio group - Ooooooh! Here are the essential things you can do if you want to play your part as your group learns to use Loomio together.

## Add your profile photo
Reading text on a screen can be a bit impersonal. Make things friendlier by adding a profile photo to give a face to your name. 

## Configure your email settings.
Staying up to date with the conversation is super important. Each communication channel has it's own unwritten expectations. People respond to text messages pretty quickly. Generally it's a good idea to respond to Loomio posts within about a day.

Email settings are an important way of staying up to date. 
Getting emailed about each discussion and proposal is the default. You get emails which have the full content of the discussion or proposal, and you can just hit reply to participate.

Yesterday on Loomio is a daily update of what happened on Loomio in the last 24 hours. 1 email that is sent at 6am, your time. Just read it like a newspaper in the morning to catch up on the various conversations in your Loomio groups.

No emails is sometimes the best emails. But we recommend you keen mentions enabled, as this is how people get your attention when they need to.

## Check if anyone is missing
Check the members list on your Loomio group page. Are people missing? Maybe give them a phone call or an email to make sure they’ve got their invitation.

## Say "Hello"
There’s a thread in your group where you can introduce yourself. What part of your background is relevant to this group? What do you want to achieve together?

## Respond in a timely fashion

## Think of others
Bring people into the discussion by mentioning them: type “@” followed by their name to let them know you’re looking for their input. Try to notice if people have not participated and mention them if you would like to hear them in the conversation.

## Stay on topic
if you notice that you are writing a comment that isn’t about the topic of the thread, but is about something else... start a new thread!

## Be concise
Summarise your thoughts into a paragraph or two. Long comments can be hard to follow.

## Keep the title and context up to date
Make it easy for people to catch up by updating the thread context and title with concise information as the discussion progresses. *link to help*

## Help maintain the vibe!
Be expressive! Use emojis (click the smiley face in the Add a Comment box) to add colour, fun, and extra meaning to your comments.
Be positive. Thank people. And use emojis. Respect difference, it's where the good stuff is when you work together.
Be positive. eg: "Great correction! That's a much better way to do it."
Equire "Can you clarify what you mean?"
