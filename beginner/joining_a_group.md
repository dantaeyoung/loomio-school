# Joining your first Loomio group

If you're not sure what Loomio is, check out ["What is Loomio?"](overview.md).

Someone has invited you to join a Loomio group! Here are the essential things you can do to support the group to get off to a good start.

## Add your profile photo 👩🏽

Reading text on a screen can be a bit impersonal. Make things friendlier by adding a profile photo to give a face to your name. 

## Configure your email settings 📬

Email notifications are the main way Loomio keeps you updated on what's happening in your group.

By default we email you most of the activity on Loomio as it happens. This helps to keep people engaged in the early stages of a group, but can get overwhelming if there is a lot of activity.

To be kept up to date with a minimum of emails, set each of your groups to "No emails" and ensure you have "Daily summary emails" and "Mentions" enabled.

Visit the [email settings page](https://www.loomio.org/email_preferences) to configure the email settings to suit your preferences.

## Check if anyone is missing 🔍

Check the members list on your Loomio group page. Are people missing? Maybe give them a phone call or an email to make sure they’ve got their invitation.

## Say "Hello" 👋🏽

Every Loomio group starts off with an Introductions thread. This is a place where you can say hello and introduce yourself. Share why you've joined the group, tell people something about yourself so they can understand you a bit better.
