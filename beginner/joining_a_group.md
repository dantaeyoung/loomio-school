# Joining a Loomio group
Someone has invited you to join a Loomio group! Here are the essential things you can do to get off to a good start.

If you're not sure what Loomio is, check out ["What is Loomio?"](overview.md).

## Have a look around
Give yourself a tour by clicking around the app. Down the left is your *sidebar*, which gives you links to your groups, discussions, and decisions.

## Add your profile photo üë©üèΩ 
Reading text on a screen can be a bit impersonal. Make things friendlier by adding a profile photo to give a face to your name. (If you're not comfortable showing your face, pick any image to represent you.)

To change your profile picture, click *"edit profile"* on the sidebar.

## Configure your email settings üì¨ 

Email notifications are the main way Loomio keeps you updated on what's happening in your group.

By default, we email you most of the activity on Loomio as it happens. This helps to keep people engaged in the early stages of a group, but can get overwhelming if there is a lot of activity.

You can be emailed about all activity, only important activity, or keep up to date with daily summary emails. Or you can turn off emails entirely. It's up to you.

Visit the [email settings](https://www.loomio.org/email_preferences) to configure the email settings to suit your preferences. This page is linked from the sidebar.

## Is anyone missing? üîç 

Check the members list on your Loomio group page. Are people missing? Click "invite people" to add them. Give them a phone call or an email to make sure they got their invitation.

## Say "Hello" üëãüèΩ
Every Loomio group starts off with an Introductions thread. This is a place where you can say hello. Share why you've joined the group, and tell people something about yourself so they can understand you a bit better.

## This is *your* group
Discussions and Proposals are invitations to use your voice. It's ok to change your mind. It's ok to be unsure. Your perspective is valued - that's why you've been invited to the group! 

Loomio is about participation, so find your unique way to contribute to ongoing threads. And when you feel comfortable, think about starting discussions and proposals of your own.
