Loomio is a online tool for groups of people to make decisions together. There are 4 key steps to using Loomio with your group.

## 1. Gather

A Loomio group is an online place for people to have discussions make decisions together.

## 2. Discuss

Discussions are where people share their experience, preferences and points of view. Update the group on what's happening. 
Each topic being discussed lives within it's own thread. Over time you'll create an archive of discussions.

Robust discussion allows people to understand issues

Start a **thread** to have a discussion with your group members.

Use the **thread title** and **context** to introduce the topic: keep each thread focussed on one topic, and make it clear what kind of input you're looking for.

Anyone in the group can contribute to the discussion by posting a **comment**, where they can **@mention** people to get their attention and **attach files** to share additional information.

## 3. Propose

Use a **proposal** to move a thread towards a conclusion: you can test an idea, or make a decision. You’ll get a visual summary of how everyone feels.

There are many uses for Loomio proposals, e.g. to test an idea for consensus, check that everyone has completed an action, or to recruit people to work on a specific project.

If you're wondering how to move a conversation forward, the answer is almost always **start a proposal**!

## 4. Decide & Act

While the proposal is open, everyone in the group can **state their position**, using  one of the four options:

* **Agree** if you’re happy with the proposal.
* **Abstain** if you’re happy for the group to decide without you.
* **Disagree** if you could tolerate this proposal going ahead, but believe there might be a better alternative.
* **Block** if you’ve got serious objections to the proposal going ahead.

When the proposal closes, notify everyone of the **outcome** so the next steps are clear.
