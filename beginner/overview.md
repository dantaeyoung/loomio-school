# What is Loomio?

Loomio is an app for collaborative decision-making. It's an online tool that empowers groups to come together, build shared understanding and agree on a clear course of action.

It's used by thousands of groups around the world to:

- Make inclusive decisions without having in person meetings.
- Approve funding or service applications
- Engage stakeholders in policy development

Our [case studies](http://loomio.school/case_studies.html) section highlights the variety of ways groups have used Loomio and may provide some inspiration to you.

It's an open source web application which works great on mobile phones.

There are 4 key steps to using Loomio with your group.

## 1. Gather

A Loomio group is an online place for people to have discussions and make decisions together.


## 2. Discuss

Anyone in the group can start a discussion. Everyone in the group is able to participate.

## 3. Propose

Proposals are the defining feature of Loomio. Use a proposal to move a discussion towards conclusion: you can test an idea, or make a decision.

If you're wondering how to move a conversation forward, the answer is almost always **start a proposal**!

## 4. Decide & Act

While a proposal is open, everyone in the group can give their position:

* **Agree** if you’re happy with the proposal.
* **Abstain** if you’re happy for the group to decide without you.
* **Disagree** if you believe there might be a better alternative.
* **Block** if you’ve got serious objections to the proposal going ahead.

When you select your position, you can also enter a short **statement** to explain why you voted the way you did.

Loomio makes it easy to understand what people think about a proposal. A few iterations through this process is ususally all that is needed to ensure a decision is right for the group.

When the proposal closes, the author can share an **outcome** so everyone knows what the next steps are.

## That's it.
In practice you'll find that you repeat steps 2 to 4 as you work together to find the best course of action for the group. Over time you'll build a history of decisions you can refer to.
