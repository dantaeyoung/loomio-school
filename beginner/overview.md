There are 4 key steps to using Loomio with your group.

## 1. Gather

A Loomio group is an online place for people to have discussions and make decisions together.


## 2. Discuss

Anyone in the group can start a discussion. Everyone in the group is able to participate.

## 3. Propose

Use a **proposal** to move a discussion towards conclusion: you can test an idea, or make a decision.

If you're wondering how to move a conversation forward, the answer is almost always **start a proposal**!

## 4. Decide & Act

While proposals are open, everyone in the group can **vote** using one of four positions:

* **Agree** if you’re happy with the proposal.
* **Abstain** if you’re happy for the group to decide without you.
* **Disagree** if you believe there might be a better alternative.
* **Block** if you’ve got serious objections to the proposal going ahead.

As you vote you can also enter a brief **statement** to explain your reasoning.

When the proposal closes, the author can share an **outcome** to interpret the results back to the group.

## That's it.
In practice you'll find that you repeat steps 2 to 4 as you work together to find the best course of action for the group. Over time you'll build a history of decisions you can refer to.
