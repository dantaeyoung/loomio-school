# Setting up a Loomio group and inviting people in.

Don't rush through setting up your group- it's when you create the arrival experience for the rest of your group.

It's likely that people have some apprehensions about joining an online decision making space - For now, you're the host, and this is your opportunity to make them feel welcome and comfortable.

You can learn a lot about how to host a Loomio group by looking at how to host an in-person meeting.

For example: It's important to send invitations which explain what the meeting is about, when it is and how to get there. On the day of, you would arrange the furniture and setup the space to create a sense of purpose. Once people have arrived, a round of introductions lets people know who is in the room. Beginning the discussion with a short presentation ensures that people have the information they need to partipate well.

It sounds simple but it takes some thought and experience to do it well.

This is list of the main things you can do to shape the experience people have when they arrive in your group. We recommend you adapt the advice to suit the needs of your group.

## Define your group puprose

With a clear purpose, people can make judgement calls about how to best serve the group, what how to participate, and what outcomes to aim for.

Your Loomio group page has a space for a short purpose statement right under the group's name. If you know the purpose, update this field so that everyone can see it when they visit the group.

If you have not discussed purpose with your group, then we highly recommend that one of your first Loomio discussions be on the topic of purpose.

## Upload your profile photo

Seeing someone's face next to what they've written can make a big difference to the reading experience.

The invitation email people get when you invite them to join your group includes your profile photo to make it feel more trustworthy. So before you send invitations out you need to upload your profile photo.

## Upload a group cover photo

Uploading a cover photo that has some meaning to your group significantly improves the sense of belonging when you arrive on the group page.

If you have one, use a photo from the last time you gathered together as a group. Or, if you need some inspiration, Check out [Unsplash](https://unsplash.com/), a gallery of beautiful, free images.

## Start an introductions thread

When you arrive in a new space it can feel strange until you meet some other people there.

Start a thread inviting people to introduce themselves  and share something about why they've joined, or what's on their mind, or what experience they have. It's a great way to start building relationships within the group.

It's also the first time of writing a comment in a Loomio thread for many people, so it's a good time for people get comfortable with using Loomio.

## Invite people into their new space.

So you've written up your purpose, uploaded your profile picture, set a group photo and started a thread for people to participate in when they arrive. You're ready to invite people into the group!

You can enter email addresses to have invitation emails sent to people, or share a team link with people if that's easier. The important thing at this stage is that you followup on people who miss the invitation email or get stuck when signing up. You don't want people feeling left out, or a group of people making decisions without some of the people.

You can check who has accepted their invitation and who is yet to accept on the members page. If people join but don't introduce themselves, then welcome them to the group in the introductions thread with an @mention.
