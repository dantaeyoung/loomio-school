# Starting a Loomio group

Don't rush through setting up your group- it's when you create the arrival experience for the rest of your group.

It's likely that people have some apprehensions about joining an online decision making space - For now, you're the host, and it's your job to make them feel welcome and comfortable.

You can learn a lot about how to host a Loomio group by looking at how to host an in-person meeting.

For example: It's important to send invitations which explain what the meeting is about, when it is and how to get there. On the day, you would arrange the furniture and setup the space to create a sense of purpose. Once people have arrived, a round of introductions lets people know who is in the room. Beginning the discussion with a short presentation ensures that people have the information they need to partipate well.

It sounds simple but it takes some thought and experience to do it well.

This is list of the main things you can do to shape the experience people have when they arrive in your group. We recommend you adapt the advice to suit the needs of your group.

### Define your group puprose

With a clear purpose, people can make judgement calls about how to best serve the group, what tools to deploy, and what outcomes to aim for.

Your Loomio group page has a space for a short purpose statement right under the group's name. If you know the purpose, update this field so that everyone can see it when they visit the group.

If you have not discussed purpose with your group, then we highly recommend that one of your first Loomio discussions be on the topic of purpose.

### Upload your profile photo

Seeing someone's face next to what they've written can make a big difference to the reading experience.

To make your invitation email feel friendly and trustworthy it includes your profile photo. So before you send invitations out you need to upload your profile photo.

### Upload a group cover photo

Uploading a cover photo that has some meaning to your group significantly improves the sense of belonging when you arrive on the group page.

If you have one, use a photo from the last time you gathered together as a group. Or, if you need some inspiration, Check out [Unsplash](https://unsplash.com/), a gallery of beautiful, free images.

### Start an introductions thread

When you arrive in a new place, it feels weird until you start talking to people, finding out who they are, and shaing a bit about why you're here.

By starting a thread you're creating a space for people to connect to each other and exchange the personal information they need to build upon.

Start a thread askign people to introduce themselves and say a bit about why they're here and what they hope to achieve.

## Bringing people into the space.
Now is is a good time to send the invitations out to your group members.

If people don't respond in the first day, we'll automatically send a reminder email the next day.

You can check who has accepted their invitation and who is yet to accept on the members page. If people don't introduce themselves, then we recommend you welcome them to the group in the introductions thread, but don't put them on the spot.

### Did everyone find their way in? 
Maybe pickup the phone and help someone get in. If they're stuck you can email them the team link.
