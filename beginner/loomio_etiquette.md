# Loomio Etiquette


## Respectful disagreement üòé
> A [study of more than 180 teams within Google](https://rework.withgoogle.com/blog/five-keys-to-a-successful-google-team/) tells us that the number one factor in team performance is __psychological safety__.

Respectful disagreement is essential to finding the best solution for the group, but it can be challenging work.

If a disagreement online starts to get stressful, consider ways you can reach out to the individuals involved and offer support.

Be forgiving - Help people to understand your point of view. If you disagree with someone, esquire why they think or feel the way they do, rather than telling them they're in the wrong.

Be careful with humour and avoid scarcasm. These don't translate through text well and it's easy for people to mistake a funny comment as something mean.

Be expressive and say what is on your mind. Use an emoji or two to add colour, fun, and extra meaning to your comments.

## Getting attention ‚òùÔ∏è
Communicating effectively within a group depends upon each individual knowing how to best use the attention of others.

Make it Count
Send out as few messages as possible, and use each one to the max. Consider how precious people‚Äôs time is. Our attention is a commons we share - if we start overusing it, we'll degrade it for everyone. Do a quick search to see if there‚Äôs already an existing thread on the topic before posting a new one.

__Starting a discussion__ means you want to start a conversation with the group.  By default everyone is emailed when you start a discussion, so you should assume that it will get everyone's attention. 

__Mentioning__ people is a direct way of asking for someone's attention within a discussion. It's a really useful way to ask someone a question or get their attention within an existing discussion.

__Raising a proposal__ is a fantastic way to ask everyone in the group to give their point of view within a specified time frame.

__disagreeing and blocking__ are good indicators that someone has something important to say. If people disagree or block a proposal, give them an opportunity to explain themselves and let them be heard.

Some people will not participate unless prompted, it takes a little care to do this in an inviting way but try to encourage people to participate by saying how you'd value what they have to say on this.

## When should you expect a reply? ‚åöÔ∏è
Each communication channel has it's own unwritten expectations. People respond to text messages pretty quickly. You would expect to get a response to an email within a day, unless someone is away. Generally it's a good idea to respond to Loomio posts within about the same time as you would a email.

## Stay on topic and be concise

Long comments can be hard to follow. If you must write a long comment, add a summary to the top of it, so people know why they should commit to a longer read.

If the comment you're writing is tangential to the topic of the discussion, start a new discussion to avoid making the thread hard to follow.

Writing good titles increases engagement and makes content easier to find. Think of titles like an email subject. They should be 1 line or less of text and describe the issue you want to discuss.

When starting a discussion put all the relevant informaiton into the context  field. Write your message as if to someone who has never heard of it before. Include links to relevant background info or previous discussions so people can catch themselves up.

It's great to include your own point of view in a discussion, keep the context area obective and write your own points of view as a comment to help maintain a robust discussion.

When raising a proposal you want to ensure that the title is clear and the details field contains all the information people need to agree or disagree.

If you are starting a discussion and have both general context as well as your own point of view, put the general context into the context box and include your point of view as it's own comment.

Starting a discussion involves choosing a clear title and providing all the contextual information people will need to participate. 
Who, what, where, why, when.
Include Links, Make it Easy

If you want people to click through to other content, include links! People will not go searching for facebook events, google docs, etc, on their own. Put everything they need right in front of people.
