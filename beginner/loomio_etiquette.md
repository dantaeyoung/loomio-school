# Loomio Etiquette üë®‚Äçüë©‚Äçüëß‚Äçüë¶

Every mode of communication comes with it's own customs about how it is used.
Being aware of these customs makes it easier to effectively use Loomio.

## This is a safe space üòé
> A [study of more than 180 teams within Google](https://rework.withgoogle.com/blog/five-keys-to-a-successful-google-team/) tells us that the number one factor in team performance is __psychological safety__.

The group is enriched when everyone is able to say what is on their mind - however speaking your mind can make you feel vulnerable. Be forgiving - Help people to understand your point of view. If you disagree with someone, enquire why they think or feel the way they do, rather than telling them they're in the wrong.

It's ok to be in the wrong. Loomio is about people developing their understanding and chaning their position if it makes sense to do so.

Respectful disagreement is essential to finding the best solution for the group, but it can also be challenging work. If a situation starts to get stressful consider ways you can reach out to the individuals involved and offer support.

Be careful with humour and avoid scarcasm. These don't translate through text well and it's easy for people to mistake a funny comment as something mean.

Be expressive! Say what it is that is on your mind. Use an emoji or two to add colour, fun, and extra meaning to your comments. When you thank people, say what you appreciate. 

## Getting attention ‚òùÔ∏è
Communicating effectively within a group depends upon each individual knowing how to best use the attention of others.

__Starting a discussion__ means you want to start a conversation with the group.  By default everyone is emailed when you start a discussion, so you should assume that it will get everyone's attention. 

__Mentioning__ people is a direct way of asking for someone's attention within a discussion. It's a really useful way to ask someone a question or get their attention within an existing discussion.

__Raising a proposal__ is a fantastic way to ask everyone in the group to give their point of view within a specified time frame.

__disagreeing and blocking__ are good indicators that someone has something important to say. If people disagree or block a proposal, give them an opportunity to explain themselves and let them be heard.

Some people will not participate unless prompted, it takes a little care to do this in an inviting way but try to encourage people to participate by saying how you'd value what they have to say on this.

## When should you expect a reply? ‚åöÔ∏è
Each communication channel has it's own unwritten expectations. People respond to text messages pretty quickly. You would expect to get a response to an email within a day, unless someone is away. Generally it's a good idea to respond to Loomio posts within about the same time as you would a email.

## Stay on topic and be concise

Long comments can be hard to follow. If you must write a long comment, add a summary to the top of it, so people know why they should commit to a longer read.

If the comment you're writing is tangential to the topic of the discussion, start a new discussion to avoid making the thread hard to follow.

When starting a discussion put all the relevant informaiton into the context  field. Write your message as if to someone who has never heard of it before. Include links to relevant background info or previous discussions so people can catch themselves up.

If you are starting a discussion and have both general context as well as your own point of view, put the general context into the context box and include your point of view as it's own comment.

Starting a discussion involves choosing a clear title and providing all the contextual information people will need to participate. 
Who, what, where, why, when.
Include Links, Make it Easy
If you want people to click through to other content, include links! People will not go searching for facebook events, google docs, etc, on their own. Put everything they need right in front of people.

Writing good titles increases engagement and makes content easier to find.
When raising a proposal you want to ensure that the title is clear and the details contain enough information for people to participate
