# Loomio Etiquette üë®‚Äçüë©‚Äçüëß‚Äçüë¶

Every mode of communication comes with it's own customs about how it is used.

## Be conscious of getting attention ‚òùÔ∏è
We live in an attention economy. A huge part of groups communicating effectively depends upon each individual knowing how to best use the attention of others in the group.

If you have a topic that needs the attention of the group. Start a discussion. With the default user settings, this sends everyone an email, so it's a good way to kick off a new topic.

If there is someone in the group who's perspective is missing from the conversation, use the @mention feature to bring them in.

Some people will not participate unless prompted, it takes a little care to do this in an inviting way but try to encourage people to participate by saying how you'd value what they have to say on this.

## Respond in a timely fashion ‚åöÔ∏è
Staying up to date with the conversation is super important. Each communication channel has it's own unwritten expectations. People respond to text messages pretty quickly. You would expect to get a response to an email within a day, unless someone is away. Generally it's a good idea to respond to Loomio posts within about the same time as you would a email.

## Stay on topic. Be concise
Put all the relevant info you can very concisely in the title. Many people  will look no further than the subject line. Who, what, where, why, when.

If you're starting a discussion, make sure to make the title as succinct as possible. 

When raising a proposal you want to ensure that the title is short and the details contain just the right amount of information so people can decide by reading the proposal text.

if you notice that you are writing a comment that isn‚Äôt about the topic of the thread, but is about something else... start a new thread!

Reread your comments before you post. Check that you're concise and clear and really mean what you've written.

Long comments can be hard to follow. If you must write a long comment, add a summary to the top of it, so people get your point, then can read more for your detailed reasoning.


## Help maintain the vibe üòé

A [study of more than 180 teams within Google](https://rework.withgoogle.com/blog/five-keys-to-a-successful-google-team/) says the number one factor in team performance is psychological safety. IE: Team members being able to take risks without feeling insecure or embarassed.

Respect difference, it's where the good stuff is when you work together. Respectful disagreement is essential to finding the best solution for the group, but it can also be hard work.

Be forgiving - Help people to understand your point of view. Enquire why someone thinks or feels the way they do, rather than telling them they're wrong.

Be careful with humour and avoid scarcasm. These don't translate through text well and it's easy for people to mistake a funny comment as something mean.

Be expressive! Say what it is that is on your mind. Use an emoji or two to add colour, fun, and extra meaning to your comments. When you thank people, say what you appreciate.
