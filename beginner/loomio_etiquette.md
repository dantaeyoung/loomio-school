# Loomio Etiquette


## Respectful disagreement üòé
> A [study of more than 180 teams within Google](https://rework.withgoogle.com/blog/five-keys-to-a-successful-google-team/) tells us that the number one factor in team performance is __psychological safety__.

Respectful disagreement is essential to finding the best solution for the group, but it can be challenging work.

If a disagreement online starts to get stressful, reach out to the individuals involved and offer support.

## Clear communication
Be careful with humour and avoid sarcasm. These don't translate through text well and it's easy for people to mistake a funny comment as something mean.

Be expressive and say what is on your mind. Use an emoji or two to add colour, fun, and extra meaning to your comments.

Long comments can be hard to follow. If you must write a long comment, add a summary to the top of it.

If you're writing a comment that is tangential to the discussion, start a new discussion to avoid making the thread hard to follow.

## Getting attention ‚òùÔ∏è
Effective use of Loomio means knowing how to get attention from the group.

__Starting a discussion__ means you want to start a new conversation with the group.  By default everyone is emailed when you start a discussion, so you should assume that it will get everyone's attention. 

__Mentioning__ people is a direct way of asking for someone's attention within a discussion. It's expected that you respond when someone _mentions_ you.

__Raising a proposal__ is the most powerful way to get attention from your group. Ensure that you have a clear ask in your proposal, and the system will do it's best to get a response from everyone before the closing time.

__disagreeing and blocking__ are indicators that someone wants to be listened to. If people disagree or block a proposal, give them an opportunity to explain themselves.

## When to expect a reply? ‚åöÔ∏è
Each communication channel has it's own unwritten expectations. People respond to text messages pretty quickly. You would expect to get a response to an email within a day, unless someone is away. Generally it's a good idea to respond to Loomio posts within about the same time as you would a email.
