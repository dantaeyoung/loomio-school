# Loomio Etiquette 👨‍👩‍👧‍👦

Every mode of communication comes with expectations about how it is used. 

## Respond in a timely fashion ⌚️ 
Staying up to date with the conversation is super important. Each communication channel has it's own unwritten expectations. People respond to text messages pretty quickly. Generally it's a good idea to respond to Loomio posts within about a day.


## Stay on topic and be concise☝️
if you notice that you are writing a comment that isn’t about the topic of the thread, but is about something else... start a new thread!

Summarise your thoughts into a paragraph or two. Long comments can be hard to follow.

## Share what's on your mind 🗣


## Help maintain the vibe 😎
Be expressive! Use emojis (click the smiley face in the Add a Comment box) to add colour, fun, and extra meaning to your comments.

Be positive. Thank people. And use emojis. Respect difference, it's where the good stuff is when you work together. It's everyones job to create the place they want to be in.

Be positive. eg: "Great correction! That's a much better way to do it."
Equire "Can you clarify what you mean?"
