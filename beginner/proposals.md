# Ways to use proposals
Proposals are our thing. We over use them. We really need to build more decision types into Loomio.. but we've managed a lot with a very simple too.

Proposals have
Find volunteers to address a problem and report back to the group.
Anyone can raise a proposal, and they give your group members an opportunity to have their say about a specific course of action.
Here are some ways proposals can be used:
👍 🏾Test for agreement
​When you see agreement emerge in the discussion: test it with a proposal. You’ll either get a mandate to act, or you’ll learn about the disagreements you need to work through.
👓 Engagement check
Sometimes you need everyone in your group to complete an action, such as reading a document before an important meeting. You can start a proposal to remind people to get something done by a deadline.
🚀 Any volunteers?
Raise a proposal which asks for people to say “yes” if they want to make it happen. This will give you a list of people who’ve publicly committed to take action.
When you see someone else start a proposal, give your best position:
If you agree, great. Green thumb. State why you support the proposal.
If you're not sure yet, then say so. Abstain and say where you're at.
If you think we can do better: disagree. Suggest an alternative.
Block is special. Use it wisely, don't block unless you feel very strongly that a “no” is not good enough.
Vote, vote now, vote again later. Say what you think and change your mind when you get more information or insight from the group.
Every vote lets you make a short statement to explain your position. Those summary statements are an excellent way for people to catch up on a proposal if they are coming in late.
As always, if you have any questions, please let me know :)



## Alanna says 95% of the facilitation questions she gets about Loomio are solved by "Start a proposal"

## When agreeing on the solution is not working, switch to agreeing on the problem. then to agreeing process to address the problem.
