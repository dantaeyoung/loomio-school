# Using proposals
Proposals are the defining feature of Loomio. They're an incredibly flexible tool you can use to gather views from everyone in your group in an easy to understand way. When combined with robust discussion, proposals allow you to converge towards a clear outcome.

## Your first proposal 
It's clearly up to you to decide what the right thing is, but we recommend you start using proposals early on. 

Our research shows that groups that have 2 proposals in their first week continue to use Loomio successfully for a long time.

So maybe you want to have a proposal to confirm the purpose of your group. Or to have a staff party or find people who want to be a part of your first working group.

Most often you don't know what the first proposal is, until you have a discussion together. Look out for when it seems like there is a piece of the puzzle the group seems to agree upon.


## Using proposals regularly
Often people will write comments that look a lot like proposals.. in this case it's just a matter of encouraging that person to raise a proposal.

When agreeing on the solution is not working, switch to agreeing on the problem. then to agreeing process to address the problem.

We've spent a lot of time studying use of Loomio. What makes a group successful? Likely to continue to use loomio? Groups that start at least 2 proposals in their first week are 
Once you have people discussing, the next step is to prompt people to start proposals. It's truely as simple as "Hey that's sounds like a proposal to me. Can you please write that as a proposal?"

What proposal can you run to develop the practice of using loomio within your group?

## Be specific about the decision being made. 
When starting a proposal be as specific as you can, so everyone knows what it means to agree or disagree. If appropriate, include information on who will execute a proposal, not just what the proposal is.

## Set closing time consciously
Think about when you need the decision to be made, and how the proposal closing time will affect engagement from your group members e.g. you might want to time the proposal so it closes before a meeting, or avoid closing on a weekend. You can always extend the closing date if need be.

## Communicate the outcome
When your proposal closes, you’ll be prompted to set a proposal outcome. You can use this as a way to remind the whole group what you agreed to do together.



## Ways of using proposals
There is no limit to the number of ways you can use the proposal feature, but over time we find that these are commonly used ways.


1. Consensus Finder

Thread: Ethical Lending. 

If the comments seem to point to general agreement, test this assumption by proposing agreement explicitly. If you don’t reach consensus immediately, you’ll often find that a better solution is self-evident, once people have had a chance to clearly state their objections.


### Confirm consensus
> Proposal: We should approve this application for funding. 
> 
> Clara’s funding application (#217) meets all our requirements. Let’s support her great project.

The primary way proposals are used is to confirm the group supports them to take some action on behalf of the group.

If the comments seem to point to general agreement, test this assumption by proposing agreement explicitly.
You’ll either get a mandate to act, or you’ll uncover important disagreements you need to work through as people clearly state their objection.

### Uncover the Controversy
If there are two or more clear competing ideas, propose supporting one to reveal how the group feels about it, or if the split has been accurately understood. Controversial topics will almost always require a series of proposals to build shared understanding.

### Series of Small Yes’s

_insert the images from the blogs here_
Thread: Conference Opportunity. Proposal: We host the conference; dates to be confirmed Looks like it is going to take a while to figure out the logistics, but can we agree that we definitely want to host the conference?

Sometimes it helps to agree principles first, then get into agreeing the details. If the discussion reveals complexity, break down the issue into smaller parts and build shared understanding piece by piece so you can clear the parts you have agreement on and focus on the parts the group still wants to discuss.

### Silent Majority

Thread: Quarterly report. Proposal: I’m happy with the figures presented in the quarterly report. There hasn’t been much engagement in here - just want to check that you are all happy with the figures as they are presented in the report.

If there have been few comments, or comments only from a select few people, start a proposal to draw out all the voices. You may end up confirming the status quo, but by asking for explicit input, you’ll see if agreement emerges or if engagement brings up the deeper issues.

### Engagement Check

Thread: Members meeting on Monday. Proposal: I’ve filled in the member survey. Please make sure you fill in the member survey before our meeting on Monday

Sometimes you need everyone in your group to complete an action, such as reading a document before an important meeting. You can start an Engagement Check proposal as a way to remind people to complete the required action within a defined time period.

### Polarising Minority

Thread: Employment policy. Proposal: Share our pay rates publicly. I know this feels a bit radical, but it is a proactive way for us to live our values of transparency.

Raise a proposal in line with what the majority seem to agree with, and reveal the fact that disagreeing parties are in the minority. Give them a chance to clearly state their objections, or to realise their position is not supported by others and reconsider.

### Window of Opportunity

Thread: Design workshops. Proposal: I’m happy with the design team using the shared space to host workshops this week. There’ll be a bit of extra noise and traffic in the space but it will be a great way for us to engage some of the new volunteers.

Have you heard the phrase, “speak now or forever hold your peace”? The Window of Opportunity proposal is a way to say, “I’m going to take this action, so if you have anything to contribute, now is the time.” It can be a way to discover important information or reservations before it’s too late, and to get a mandate to move forward.

### Temperature Check

Thread: Concerns about private information. Proposal: Temperature Check: we should change the privacy policy. I have reservations about this, but I wonder how the group feels

Sometimes you have a hunch, but you’re not sure if it is a good idea or not. Use a Temperature Check when you want to survey opinions, rather than advocate for a particular position.

### Any Volunteers?

Thread: Bike parking. Proposal: Call for volunteers: join the bike rack working bee. We’re getting together on Saturday morning to build a bike rack out of recycled timber. Any volunteers?

Raise a proposal which asks for people to say “yes” if they are keen to be part of making it happen. This will give you a list of people to follow up with to form a working group, which ensures the conversation will actually turn into action.

---

If you agree, great. Green thumb. State why you support the proposal.
If you're not sure yet, then say so. Abstain and say where you're at.
If you think we can do better: disagree. Suggest an alternative.
Block is special. Use it wisely, don't block unless you feel very strongly that a “no” is not good enough.
Vote, vote now, vote again later. Say what you think and change your mind when you get more information or insight from the group.
Every vote lets you make a short statement to explain your position. Those summary statements are an excellent way for people to catch up on a proposal if they are coming in late.
As always, if you have any questions, please let me know :)

## Consider the whole pie graph.
Proposals don't have to pass. Infact most of the time they don't. The most interesting proposals are those that have a mix of views and cause the group to work together to find the best solution.

## Find volunteers to address a problem and report back to the group.
Anyone can raise a proposal, and they give your group members an opportunity to have their say about a specific course of action.
