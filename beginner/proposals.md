# Using proposals
Proposals are the defining feature of Loomio. They're an incredibly flexible tool you can use to gather views from everyone in your group in an easy to understand way. When combined with robust discussion, proposals allow you to converge towards a clear outcome.

## Your first proposal 
It's clearly up to you to decide what the right thing is, but we recommend you start using proposals early on. 

Our research shows that groups that have 2 proposals in their first week continue to use Loomio successfully for a long time.

So maybe you want to have a proposal to confirm the purpose of your group. Or to have a staff party or find people who want to be a part of your first working group.

Most often you don't know what the first proposal is, until you have a discussion together. Look out for when it seems like there is a piece of the puzzle the group seems to agree upon.


## Using proposals regularly
Often people will write comments that look a lot like proposals.. in this case it's just a matter of encouraging that person to raise a proposal.

When agreeing on the solution is not working, switch to agreeing on the problem. then to agreeing process to address the problem.

We've spent a lot of time studying use of Loomio. What makes a group successful? Likely to continue to use loomio? Groups that start at least 2 proposals in their first week are 
Once you have people discussing, the next step is to prompt people to start proposals. It's truely as simple as "Hey that's sounds like a proposal to me. Can you please write that as a proposal?"

What proposal can you run to develop the practice of using loomio within your group?

## Be specific about the decision being made. 
When starting a proposal be as specific as you can, so everyone knows what it means to agree or disagree. If appropriate, include information on who will execute a proposal, not just what the proposal is.

## Set closing time consciously
Think about when you need the decision to be made, and how the proposal closing time will affect engagement from your group members e.g. you might want to time the proposal so it closes before a meeting, or avoid closing on a weekend. You can always extend the closing date if need be.




## Ways of using proposals
There is no limit to the number of ways you can use the proposal feature, but over time we find that these are commonly used ways.

## Confirm agreement
The primary way proposals are used is to confirm the group supports them to take some action on behalf of the group.

When you see agreement emerge in the discussion: test it with a proposal. You‚Äôll either get a mandate to act, or you‚Äôll learn about the disagreements you need to work through.

## Engagement check üëì
Sometimes you need everyone in your group to complete an action, such as reading a document before an important meeting. You can start a proposal to remind people to get something done by a deadline.

## Any volunteers?
Raise a proposal which asks for people to say ‚Äúyes‚Äù if they want to make it happen. This will give you a list of people who‚Äôve publicly committed to take action.
When you see someone else start a proposal, give your best position:
If you agree, great. Green thumb. State why you support the proposal.
If you're not sure yet, then say so. Abstain and say where you're at.
If you think we can do better: disagree. Suggest an alternative.
Block is special. Use it wisely, don't block unless you feel very strongly that a ‚Äúno‚Äù is not good enough.
Vote, vote now, vote again later. Say what you think and change your mind when you get more information or insight from the group.
Every vote lets you make a short statement to explain your position. Those summary statements are an excellent way for people to catch up on a proposal if they are coming in late.
As always, if you have any questions, please let me know :)

## Consider the whole pie graph.
Proposals don't have to pass. Infact most of the time they don't. The most interesting proposals are those that have a mix of views and cause the group to work together to find the best solution.

## Find volunteers to address a problem and report back to the group.
Anyone can raise a proposal, and they give your group members an opportunity to have their say about a specific course of action.
