# Starting your group on Loomio

Getting started - it's often the hardest part of anything you do. For a Loomio group, it involves getting everyone signed up, familiar with the tool, and comfortable about making decisions together.

The promise is, if done well, the group will come to life as people start discussions and raise proposals under their own initiative.

## Talk about how you want to use Loomio. 👂👄🗣

Have a discussion with your group about using Loomio.

- What kind of decisions do you want to make on Loomio?
- Does everyone in the group need to use it?
- What kind of behaviour is not ok?
- How will Loomio compliment existing decision making?

It's realistic to expect that some people have apprehensions about adopting a new piece of software for online decision making. We recommend you spend time talking to people in your group to work through any concerns before you start.

## Start a group and have a look around. 👀

It's important that you have a good understanding of how to use Loomio so you can assist others.

Make sure you understand what each of the [group settings](https://loomio.gitbooks.io/manual/content/en/group_settings.html) are. Take particular note of the privacy settings and ensure they're right for your situation.

## Set your group purpose 🌟

With a clear purpose, people can make judgement calls about what's best for the group.

Your Loomio group page has a space for a short purpose statement right under the group's name. Update this field so that everyone is reminded of it when they visit the group.

If you're unsure, start a discussion with your group about what you want to achieve together.

## Upload your profile photo 👩🏽

Seeing someone's face next to the text they've written can make it feel more human.

Upload your profile photo before sending invitations to join the group, so that your friendly image is included in the email.

## Upload a group cover photo 🖼

Uploading a cover photo that has some meaning to your group significantly improves the sense of belonging when you arrive on the group page.

If you have one, use a photo from the last time you gathered together as a group. Or, if you need some inspiration, Check out [Unsplash](https://unsplash.com/), a gallery of beautiful, free images.

## Edit the introductions thread 👋🏽

When you arrive in a new space it can feel strange until you meet some other people there. A round of introductions is a great way for people to get to know a bit about each other and to feel more comfortable using the tool.

New groups start with an introductions thread created automatically, but we recommend you edit the thread to make it yours. Maybe ask people to share questions they are holding, or what experience they bring to the group.

## Invite people in 🙋

You're ready to invite people into the group!

Visit your group page and click the "Invite people" button.

If you have email addresses, you can send invitations to each member of your group.

If your group already has a space to chat together, you can share the team link there.

The important thing at this stage is that you follow up on people who don't make it into the group. You don't a group of people making decisions without some of the members.

If people join but don't introduce themselves, you might like to welcome them to the group with an @mention.

## Champion the use of Loomio 🏆

Model behaviour that others can learn to emulate, to be more inclusive and engaging, and help decisions progress constructively:
“@Jane that could be a good idea, why don’t you raise a proposal so we can see if the rest of the group agrees?”
“We haven’t heard from @Bill and @Ngaire … what are your thoughts?”
“It seems we might be getting off topic here. Should we start another Loomio discussion about that and bring this back to the original topic?”

If discussions are happening via email, remind the group you've agreeed to use Loomio and request people move the discussion over there.
