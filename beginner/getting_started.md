# Starting your group on Loomio

Getting started - it's often the hardest part of anything you do. For a Loomio group, it involves getting everyone signed up, familiar with the tool, and comfortable about making decisions together.

The promise is, if done well, the group will come to life as people start discussions and raise proposals under their own initiative.

This guide is for people who want to help their group adopt Loomio to make decisions together.

## Talk about how you want to use Loomio. üëÇüëÑüó£

_Meta: I need to get input from our team and consultants for this section._

What kind of decisions do you want to make on Loomio? Do you want to try it out for a specific purpose or length of time? Does everyone in the group need to use it? 

It's realistic to expect that some people have apprehensions about adopting a new piece of software for online decision making. 

We recommend you spend time talking to people in your group to work through ant concerns before you start.

Identify what the group wants to achieve together. Write this down.

Discuss a trial? Ensure you have commitment so you can follow up when people don't participate.

Talk to the members of your group about your interest in trying Loomio to see if it suits your needs. Discuss what Loomio is, and how you might use it in your group.

* It can save time on meetings - some things are easier to sort out online.
* Everyone can have input on decisions and Loomio helps to ensure that decision making is clear.
* The software does not decide anything for you. It just helps to draw discussion to conclusion.

Seek permission to facilitate your group or start a discussion on facilitation and see what emerges.

What kind of things are you happy to talk about?
Who's responsible for the safety of people in the group?
What kind of behaviour is not ok?
We recommend you ask people to commit to using Loomio for a time period with a retrospective at the end.

## Start a group and have a look around. üëÄ

It's important that you have a good understanding of how to use Loomio so you can assist others.

Make sure you understand what each of the [group settings](https://loomio.gitbooks.io/manual/content/en/group_settings.html) are, and take particular note of the privacy settings and ensure they're right for your situation.

## Set your group purpose üåü

With a clear purpose, people can make judgement calls about how to best serve the group, what how to participate, and what outcomes to aim for.

Your Loomio group page has a space for a short purpose statement right under the group's name. If you know the purpose, update this field so that everyone can see it when they visit the group.

If you have not discussed purpose with your group, then we highly recommend that one of your first Loomio discussions be about what you want to achieve together.

## Upload your profile photo üë©üèΩ

Seeing someone's face next to what they've written can make a big difference to the online reading experience.

The invitation email people receive when you invite them to join your group includes your profile photo to make it feel more trustworthy. So before you send invitations out you need to upload your profile photo. -- link to upload profile photo help page --

## Upload a group cover photo üñº

Uploading a cover photo that has some meaning to your group significantly improves the sense of belonging when you arrive on the group page.

If you have one, use a photo from the last time you gathered together as a group. Or, if you need some inspiration, Check out [Unsplash](https://unsplash.com/), a gallery of beautiful, free images.

## Edit the introductions thread üëãüèΩ

When you arrive in a new space it can feel strange until you meet some other people there. A round of introductions is a great way for people to get to know a bit about each other and to feel more comfortable using the tool.

New groups start with an introductions thread created automatically, but we recommend you edit the thread to make it yours. Maybe ask people to share questions they are holding, or what experience they bring to the group.

## Invite people in üôã

You're ready to invite people into the group!

Visit your group page and click the "Invite people" button.

If you have email addresses, you can send invitations to each member of your group.

If your group already has a space to chat together, you can share the team link there.

The important thing at this stage is that you follow up on people who don't make it into the group. You don't a group of people making decisions without some of the members.

If people join but don't introduce themselves in the introductions thread, you might like to welcome them to the group with an @mention.

## Champion the use of Loomio

The task now is to make using Loomio a habit of your group. Often it helps to lead by example. Post things to Loomio regularly. If people are discussing things in other places like email, ask the to move the discussion to Loomio.
