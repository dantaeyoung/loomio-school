# Starting your group on Loomio

The value of Loomio is unlocked when everyone in the group is able to participate.

This means getting everyone signed up, familiar with the software, and comfortable making decisions together.

If you do it well, the group will come to life as people start discussions and raise proposals under their own initiative.

## Talk about using Loomio.

_Meta: I'm going to talk to our consultatnts about this section_

It's realistic to expect that people have some apprehensions about joining an online decision making space, so we recommend you spend time talking to your group about using Loomio.

Identify what the group wants to achieve together. Write this down.

Talk to your group about your interest in trying Loomio to see if it suits your needs. Discuss what Loomio is, and how you might use it in your group.

* It can save time on meetings - some things are easier to sort out online.
* Everyone can have input on decisions and Loomio helps to ensure that decision making is clear.
* The software does not decide anything for you. It just helps to draw discussion to conclusion.


## Start a group and familiarise yourself with the settings.

It's important that you have a good understanding of how to use Loomio so you can assist others.

There are so many factors to having a smooth experience of new technology, the right support can get people through a frustrating time unscathed.

Join the [Learning to use Loomio group](), where you can practice using Loomio in a demo environment.

Also make sure you understand what each of the [group settings](https://loomio.gitbooks.io/manual/content/en/group_settings.html) are, and take particular note of the privacy settings and ensure they're right for your situation.

## Define your group purpose

With a clear purpose, people can make judgement calls about how to best serve the group, what how to participate, and what outcomes to aim for.

Your Loomio group page has a space for a short purpose statement right under the group's name. If you know the purpose, update this field so that everyone can see it when they visit the group.

If you have not discussed purpose with your group, then we highly recommend that one of your first Loomio discussions be about what you want to achieve together.

## Upload your profile photo

Seeing someone's face next to what they've written can make a big difference to the online reading experience.

The invitation email people receive when you invite them to join your group includes your profile photo to make it feel more trustworthy. So before you send invitations out you need to upload your profile photo. -- link to upload profile photo help page --

## Upload a group cover photo

Uploading a cover photo that has some meaning to your group significantly improves the sense of belonging when you arrive on the group page.

If you have one, use a photo from the last time you gathered together as a group. Or, if you need some inspiration, Check out [Unsplash](https://unsplash.com/), a gallery of beautiful, free images.

## Edit the introductions thread

When you arrive in a new space it can feel strange until you meet some other people there. A round of introductions is a great way for people to get to know a bit about each other and to feel more comfortable using the tool.

New groups start with an introductions thread created automatically, but we recommend you edit the thread to make it yours. Maybe ask people to share questions they are holding, or what experience they bring to the group.

## Invite people into their new space.

So you've written up your purpose, uploaded your profile picture, set a group photo and setup a thread for people to participate in when they arrive. You're ready to invite people into the group!

You can enter email addresses to have invitation emails sent out, or share a team link with people if that's easier. The important thing at this stage is that you followup on people who miss the invitation email or get stuck when signing up. You don't want people feeling left out, or a group of people making decisions without some of the members.

You can check who has accepted their invitation and who is yet to accept on the members page. If people join but don't introduce themselves, then welcome them to the group in the introductions thread with an @mention. --link to explain at mention--
