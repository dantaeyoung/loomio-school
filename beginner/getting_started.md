# Starting your group on Loomio

Getting started - it's often the hardest part of anything you do. For a Loomio group, it involves getting everyone signed up, familiar with the tool, and comfortable about making decisions together.

The promise is, if done well, the group will come to life as people start discussions and raise proposals under their own initiative.

This guide is for people who want to help their group adopt Loomio to make decisions together.

## Talk about how you want to use Loomio. 👂👄🗣

Have a discussion with your group about using Loomio.

- What kind of decisions do you want to make on Loomio?
- Does everyone in the group need to use it?
- What kind of behaviour is not ok?
- How will Loomio compliment existing decision making?

It's realistic to expect that some people have apprehensions about adopting a new piece of software for online decision making. We recommend you spend time talking to people in your group to work through any concerns before you start.

At this stage we also recommend you seek permission to facilitate your group or offer to start a discussion on facilitation and see what emerges.

## Start a group and have a look around. 👀

It's important that you have a good understanding of how to use Loomio so you can assist others.

Make sure you understand what each of the [group settings](https://loomio.gitbooks.io/manual/content/en/group_settings.html) are, and take particular note of the privacy settings and ensure they're right for your situation.

## Set your group purpose 🌟

With a clear purpose, people can make judgement calls about how to best serve the group, what how to participate, and what outcomes to aim for.

Your Loomio group page has a space for a short purpose statement right under the group's name. If you know the purpose, update this field so that everyone can see it when they visit the group.

If you have not discussed purpose with your group, then we highly recommend that one of your first Loomio discussions be about what you want to achieve together.

## Upload your profile photo 👩🏽

Seeing someone's face next to what they've written can make a big difference to the online reading experience.

The invitation email people receive when you invite them to join your group includes your profile photo to make it feel more trustworthy. So before you send invitations out you need to upload your profile photo. -- link to upload profile photo help page --

## Upload a group cover photo 🖼

Uploading a cover photo that has some meaning to your group significantly improves the sense of belonging when you arrive on the group page.

If you have one, use a photo from the last time you gathered together as a group. Or, if you need some inspiration, Check out [Unsplash](https://unsplash.com/), a gallery of beautiful, free images.

## Edit the introductions thread 👋🏽

When you arrive in a new space it can feel strange until you meet some other people there. A round of introductions is a great way for people to get to know a bit about each other and to feel more comfortable using the tool.

New groups start with an introductions thread created automatically, but we recommend you edit the thread to make it yours. Maybe ask people to share questions they are holding, or what experience they bring to the group.

## Invite people in 🙋

You're ready to invite people into the group!

Visit your group page and click the "Invite people" button.

If you have email addresses, you can send invitations to each member of your group.

If your group already has a space to chat together, you can share the team link there.

The important thing at this stage is that you follow up on people who don't make it into the group. You don't a group of people making decisions without some of the members.

If people join but don't introduce themselves in the introductions thread, you might like to welcome them to the group with an @mention.

## Champion the use of Loomio

The task now is to make using Loomio a habit of your group. Often it helps to lead by example. Post things to Loomio regularly. If people are discussing things in other places like email, ask the to move the discussion to Loomio.
