# Effective discussions

## Use clear language
Be careful with humour and avoid sarcasm. These don't translate through text well and it's easy for people to mistake a funny comment as something mean.

Be expressive and say what is on your mind. Use an emoji or two to add colour, fun, and extra meaning to your comments.

Long comments can be hard to follow. If you must write a long comment, add a summary to the top of it.

If you're writing a comment that is tangential to the discussion, start a new discussion to avoid making the thread hard to follow.

## Getting attention ‚òùÔ∏è
Effective use of Loomio means knowing how to get attention from the group.

__Starting a discussion__ means you want to start a new conversation with the group.  By default everyone is emailed when you start a discussion, so you should assume that it will get everyone's attention. 

__Mentioning__ people is a direct way of asking for someone's attention within a discussion. It's expected that you respond when someone _mentions_ you.

__Raising a proposal__ is the most powerful way to get attention from your group. Ensure that you have a clear ask in your proposal, and the system will do it's best to get a response from everyone before the closing time.

__disagreeing and blocking__ are indicators that someone wants to be listened to. If people disagree or block a proposal, give them an opportunity to explain themselves.

### When to expect a reply? ‚åöÔ∏è
It's ok to take some time to reply to a Loomio discussion, often it takes some consideration before you have a response formulated. In general it's best if you respond with 24 hours.

## Respectful disagreement üòé
> A [study of more than 180 teams within Google](https://rework.withgoogle.com/blog/five-keys-to-a-successful-google-team/) tells us that the number one factor in team performance is __psychological safety__.

Respectful disagreement is essential to finding the best solution for the group, but it can be challenging work.

If a disagreement online starts to get stressful, reach out to the individuals involved and offer support.

## Look after each other

Keeping people safe is more important than any issue you might discuss. As a facilitator it's part of your job to help the group to hold space for differing opinions.

If someone is expressing distress, not participating constructively, or is in a minority opinion and seems to care strongly about the topic, it‚Äôs a good indication that a face-to-face or phone conversation might be helpful.

## Who's missing?
Bring people into the discussion by mentioning them: type ‚Äú@‚Äù followed by their name to let them know you‚Äôre looking for their input. Try to notice if people have not participated and mention them if you would like to hear them in the conversation.

Are there other people the decision effects, who have not shared an opinion?
Are there experts in the field that you could bring into the room?

Remember to look out for those people who are usually quiet. Consider what experience they are having. Don't just call them out.

## Keep discussion on Loomio

## Keep the title and context relevant

## Delegate complex issues to a smaller group
If it's a complex issue, it's useful to task 3 or so people with the job of exploring and explaining the issues, and returning to the gorup with a recommendation, which can then be passed by proposal.

## Focus on the important things
Be aware of ‚Äúbike shedding‚Äù a.k.a. Parkinson's law of triviality. It‚Äôs very common for groups to spend the most time on the least important topics (‚ÄòWhat colour should we paint the bike-shed at our new office?‚Äô), because they are the easiest things to have opinions about.
