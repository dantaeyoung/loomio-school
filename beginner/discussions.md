# Facilitating discussions

To facilitate means to mediate and support group communication and interaction toward a desired outcome.

Facilitation means enabling a group to have a good discussion.

## Invite people into the discussion
Bring people into the discussion by mentioning them: type “@” followed by their name to let them know you’re looking for their input. Try to notice if people have not participated and mention them if you would like to hear them in the conversation.

Are there voices that the decision effects, who have not shared an opinion?
Are there experts in the field that you could bring into the room?

Remember to look out for those people who are usually quiet. Consider what experience they are having. Don't just call them out.

bring expertiese and experience and many points of view and diversity for a healthy group that wants to work together.

## Maintain a safe environment.

Keeping people safe is more important than any issue you might discuss. As a facilitator it's part of your job to help the group to hold space for differing opinions.

If someone is expressing distress, not participating constructively, or is in a minority opinion and seems to care strongly about the topic, it’s a good indication that a face-to-face or phone conversation might be helpful.

## Suggest that someone moves their discussion to loomio.
If you hear people discussing something in a meeting, or you see an email conversation that should be on loomio.. say so, kindly ask people to commit to using the tool. If you've discussed using loomio together this will just be a helpful reminder.

Keep threads up to date with conversation: make a comment like: As we discussed today, we've decided that ...


## Keep the title and context up to date
Make it easy for people to catch up by updating the thread context and title with concise information as the discussion progresses. *link to help*


## When there are complex things to get your head around, Delegate to a working group which then reports back to the group

If it's a complex issue, it's useful to task 3 or so people with the job of exploring and explaining the issues, and returning to the gorup with a recommendation, which can then be passed by proposal.

# Involve others
When appropriate, instead of raising a discussion or proposal yourself, quietly shoulder-tap someone else and support them to facilitate, to share a sense of leadership. Team members feeling empowered to start their own discussions is a sign of a democratic culture.
