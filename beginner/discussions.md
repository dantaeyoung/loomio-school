# Facilitating discussions

To facilitate means to mediate and support group communication and interaction toward a desired outcome.

That outcome might be something like, everyone participated in the process to plan how what organisation is going to focus on for the next 90 days

Or.. address some issue, and agree a way through it.

Facilitation - to me - means enabling a group to have a good discussion.

Acts of facilitation can come from anywhere. As you practice collaborative decision making your group will gradualy, and continuously learn about this work together.

Facilitation is a deep subject, an art, that takes a life time of practice.

Facilitation takes many shapes and forms. Groups learn to be facilitated.

This is the list of things you'll want to know when starting out on this journey.


## Maintaining a safe environment.

Keeping people safe is more important than any issue you might discuss. As a facilitator it's part of your job to help the group to hold space for differing opinions.

If things sound hurtful, or super tense, be supportive of individuals on both sides. Sometimes it's a good idea to pick up the phone and have a conversation. When people don't seem to be making progress on Loomio, ask them to talk to each other in person or on a video call.

Joshua Vial has written a great article on [resolving conflict on Loomio](http://joshuavial.com/loomio-conflict/) which you may find helpful.


## Host a discussion about how you want use Loomio together.
Talk about facilitation together. Have a proposal to confirm who is going to take the role of facilitator and for how long.

Seek permission to facilitate your group or start a discussion on facilitation and see what emerges.

What kind of things are you happy to talk about?
Who's responsible for the safety of people in the group?
What kind of behaviour is not ok?
We recommend you ask people to commit to using Loomio for a time period with a retrospective at the end.

## Suggest that someone moves their discussion to loomio.
If you hear people discussing something in a meeting, or you see an email conversation that should be on loomio.. say so, kindly ask people to commit to using the tool. If you've discussed using loomio together this will just be a helpful reminder.

Keep threads up to date with conversation: make a comment like: As we discussed today, we've decided that ...

## take notes in your meetings and post them to loomio.
This is really great way to remind people what was agreed to in the meeting.

## bring people into the discussion
Bring people into the discussion by mentioning them: type “@” followed by their name to let them know you’re looking for their input. Try to notice if people have not participated and mention them if you would like to hear them in the conversation.

Are there voices that the decision effects, who have not shared an opinion?
Are there experts in the field that you could bring into the room?



Remember to look out for those people who are usually quiet. Consider what experience they are having. Don't just call them out.

* silvia quote about putting quiet people on the spot *

## Keep the title and context up to date
Make it easy for people to catch up by updating the thread context and title with concise information as the discussion progresses. *link to help*


## When there are complex things to get your head around, Delegate to a working group which then reports back to the group

If it's a complex issue, it's useful to task 3 or so people with the job of exploring and explaining the issues, and returning to the gorup with a recommendation, which can then be passed by proposal.


Facilitation is the name for making it easy for the group to have

Loomio is a tool designed to support groups of people to collaboratively make decisions together. Like most tools, it takes practice to learn how to use Loomio effectively. Because Loomio supports groups of people, you'll need to learn how to use Loomio together.

Where are you in the collaborative decision making space? Do people include eachother in decisions already?
What is the first decision you need to make?

When I say use Loomio, I mean collabortatively make decisions together. Once you know your way around Loomio, most of the hard stuff is in listening to people, working out your differences and finding solutions that strengthen your group.
Unlike many tools, it takes a group of people practicing together to use Loomio effectively.

Maybe using Loomio is something like playing in a band.

This aim of this series is to support you, the person creating a Loomio group, to introduce Loomio to the members of your group and begin the practice of making decisions together online.

For Loomio to become used within a group effectively, someone needs to champion loomio within the group to support people to become effective users of Loomio.

For Loomio to work effectively you'll need to facilitate your group to gather, discuss, decide and act together.i

Part 2: get permission to be the facilitator or get someone else to be.



Design the experience
  Maybe just start with a round of introductions. Ask people what they hope to achieve, or why the purpose is important to them. ask them to share relevant information about themselves with the group so people know who is in the room.
  What is the right way to approach the work?

This is because when you invite people to soemthing like this, they are asking all kinds of questions:

You're not starting a loomio group, you're hosting an online experience for people.
Loomio is here to help you and your team achieve something together.
This is your purpose. Write it into the group purpose field now.

Decorate the space. Walking into a wedding hall, or a kids birthday or theater or a swimming pool.
If you have a group photo from a time you were all together, use that.
Maybe a nice photo of somewhere near the group.

Set your own profile photo. We'll combine these things together on the invitation
we send out to all your group members.

Start a discussion for people to participate in when they arrrive.
So what are they going to see? We recommend you prompt people to introduce themselves.
If you like, you can start with the example welcome message and modify it you
suit your own needs.

Think about what they need to know about each other to communicate
well together.

Ask for or offer to be the facilitator for your group. This is really an opportunity
ask for a friend to help make stuff happen. Ask if anyone wants to try to play that role for the group.

Using loomio at first means identifying your work, naming the decisions that
need to be made, by starting discussions about what you're doing. Don't jump
to decision, instead jump to discussion. Take notes of the meetings you're in and agree on actions together.. who needs to do this, who needs to do this?
Post it on loomio. I want to say, you and collaboratively edit the notes until you're ready to post htem to the wider group.

What proposal can you run to develop the practice of using loomio within your group?

Once you have people discussing, the next step is to prompt people to start proposals. It's truely as simple as "Hey that's sounds like a proposal to me. Can you please write that as a proposal?"

Proposals don't have to pass. That's not realistic. The most interesting proposals are those that have a mix of views and cause the group to work together to find the best solution.

In summary, remember to mention people, include people, and bring expertiese and experience and many points of view and diversity for a healthy group that wants to work together.


Agree on the problem before working on a solution
