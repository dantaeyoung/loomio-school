# Facilitating discussions

To facilitate means to mediate and support toward a desired outcome.

## Looking after each other

Keeping people safe is more important than any issue you might discuss. As a facilitator it's part of your job to help the group to hold space for differing opinions.

If someone is expressing distress, not participating constructively, or is in a minority opinion and seems to care strongly about the topic, it’s a good indication that a face-to-face or phone conversation might be helpful. 

Joshua Vial has written a great article on [resolving conflict on Loomio](http://joshuavial.com/loomio-conflict/) which you may find helpful.

## Invite people into the discussion
Bring people into the discussion by mentioning them: type “@” followed by their name to let them know you’re looking for their input. Try to notice if people have not participated and mention them if you would like to hear them in the conversation.

Are there other people the decision effects, who have not shared an opinion?
Are there experts in the field that you could bring into the room?

Remember to look out for those people who are usually quiet. Consider what experience they are having. Don't just call them out.

## Keep discussion on Loomio
If you see an email conversation that should be on loomio.. say so, kindly ask people to commit to using the tool. If you've discussed using loomio together this will just be a helpful reminder.

Keep threads up to date with conversation: make a comment like: As we discussed today, we've decided that ...


## Keep the title and context relevant
Make it easy for people to catch up by updating the thread context and title with concise information as the discussion progresses. *link to help*


## Delegate complex issues to a smaller group
If it's a complex issue, it's useful to task 3 or so people with the job of exploring and explaining the issues, and returning to the gorup with a recommendation, which can then be passed by proposal.

## Focus on the important things
Be aware of “bike shedding” a.k.a. Parkinson's law of triviality. It’s very common for groups to spend the most time on the least important topics (‘What colour should we paint the bike-shed at our new office?’), because they are the easiest things to have opinions about.

## Engage others in facilitation
Model behaviour that others can learn to emulate, to be more inclusive and engaging, and help decisions progress constructively:
- “@Jane that could be a good idea, why don’t you raise a proposal so we can see if the rest of the group agrees?”
- “We haven’t heard from @Bill and @Ngaire … what are your thoughts?”
- “It seems we might be getting off topic here. Should we start another Loomio discussion about that and bring this back to the original topic?”
