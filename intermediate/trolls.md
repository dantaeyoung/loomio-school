# Don't Feed the Trolls: How to Encourage Good Behaviour Online

*We go this email from a journalist. I want to write a good answer for them and then publish it on the blog.*

> Hope you're well. Working on an article for The Guardian regarding how trolls can be prevented from hijacking online democracy initiatives, and would love to get Loomio's perspective. If someone from the Loomio team could get back to me regarding the following questions by close of business New Zealand time on the 19th that'd be of great help:
> 
> Online interactions are notorious for being hijacked by trolls - has Loomio experienced this as an issue? If so, what happened and how did you respond? If not, had you already put safeguards in place to prevent such problems?
> 
> The internet can have a tendency for whimsy, such as the case of “Boaty McBoatface” winning an online poll to determine the name of a new polar research ship earlier this year. Is there a risk of people using online democracy platforms to, say, prioritise novelty projects for a laugh instead of meeting more urgent needs? Does Loomio do anything to mitigate this risk?
> 
> It could be argued that traditional democratic structures are currently being hijacked by trolls of their own, most notably in the shape of Donald Trump in the US - what does the rise of his style of politics mean for platforms such as Loomio?

## How do you encourage good behaviour online? 

Look to sites like MetaFilter, StackOverflow, Slashdot, or Quora. They all use a combination of technical and cultural components to create an environment that's biased towards high-quality respectful participation.

From our experience designing [Loomio](http://loomio.org) and hosting big public discussions, we've learnt a lot about trolls. It's a complex topic, but here are a few facets:

---

**Moderation**: there's no substitute for hosting. Never underestimate the value of having an engaged community manager on hand to hold a space, invite participation, encourage respectful dialogue, redirect off-topic contributions, and if necessary, enforce boundaries. 

Boundaries are really important - at Loomio we developed our Community Moderation Policy [in collaboration with our community](https://www.loomio.org/d/DkoxeI3Q/community-moderation-policy-let-s-design-it-together), so our moderators have an explicit mandate to act.

Without clear boundaries, you immediately exclude everyone that doesn't want to expose themselves to harassment. It's like saying 'we only want jerks here please.'

---

**Invitation**: what are people being invited into? With Loomio, the invitation is explicit: we're here to deliberate on a specific topic, usually with a known group of people, and a clear pathway to real world action.

If the invitation is unclear, like, "hey random internet users, what do you think of my cool idea?", you're much more likely to see trolling behaviour.

---

**Identity + Commitment**: The more people are committed, the less you have to worry about them acting out. Most Loomio groups are composed of people who know each other, so we don't see a lot of trolling. In more open, loosely connected groups, you have to work to create the sense of shared purpose and identity that brings out the best in people.

It's possible to have a healthy online collaboration between anonymous participants, but this generally only happens when the participants are committed to some collective identity or shared purpose, e.g. maintaining an amazing free online encyclopedia.

---

**Business model**: online platforms that are funded by advertising are optimised for maximum page-views. This means the awful flame wars you see in the comments section on YouTube and most newspaper websites are actually good for business. The incentives are misaligned. 

On the other hand, the sites that have a high resistance to trolls depend on high-quality discussion as a central component of their value proposition, so they invest a lot in making it work.

---

This all adds up to create an environment that is far less tolerant of trolls.

In 2013, [Loomio worked with the Wellington City Council](https://blog.loomio.org/2013/11/01/wellington-city-council-uses-loomio/) to engage citizens in developing a new alcohol management strategy for the city. One of the participants came in with a lot of noise and off-kilter suggestions: they weren't 'trolling' exactly, but definitely participating in a way that would be disruptive in a traditional town hall meeting. On Loomio though, between the moderators and the software design, we managed to focus on the one useful contribution in amongst the 10 outlandish ideas. In the end, this participant played a really important role in getting the conversation started, even just by giving the quieter people something to disagree with.

## Tips from experienced Loomio facilitators

These tips come from Cam Findlay [who used Loomio to development government policy for open source software licensing](https://www.ict.govt.nz/guidance-and-resources/case-studies/open-data/nzgoal-software-extension/). Appropriately, these tips are shared under a [CC-BY-4.0 license](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/).

* Don't feed them by replying with the same emotional response they put forward... that's what they want.
* Make sure to respond if you think it will trigger other community members to make an emotional response... remember respond doesn't equal resolve.
* Learn to read between the lines of what they are saying, trolls are often frustrated idealists and do have legitimate points to raise. Pick out the facts from their comment and only reply to those, avoid getting caught up in the emotional whirlwind.
* If you have a code of conduct (hint: you should!), point them at this and give them a friendly warning at first. Everyone has a bad day sometimes. Remember that most people are well-meaning.
* Get them on the phone or talk in person if possible. It might be a matter of perception given that we only get 7% of communication by the actual words we use, the rest being tone, gesture, body language etc. which doesn't come across in the online space (yet).
* Banning is a last resort, shouldn't be taken lightly and should be carried out in accordance with your code of conduct to ensure it's done fairly and consistently.

Regarding the **politics** question, now you get out of Loomio territory and into my opinion. So my own personal view:

A lot of people in my generation (80's kids) have never seen a connection between their participation in the political process, and change in the real world.

We've been governed by left-wing and right-wing parties, but somehow the neoliberal agenda has progressed uninterrupted. Productivity keeps increasing, but the real income of 99% of people in the West has been stagnant for the last 40 years. 

We have a generation that has learned that their vote has little to no impact on their lives, so you see voter participation plummeting. 

That's how I interpret Brexit: nobody expected a vote *to actually change anything*. And you can say what you like about Trump, but nobody doubts that he would *actually change things* if he won.

What's the solution? 

Well either we back away from democracy, and leave society to be managed by technocrats and corporations, or, we double down on our commitment to democracy: lean in and raise the stakes.

As a citizen, I want agenda-setting, budget-setting, and policy-setting power. 

This is not wishful thinking, they're already doing it in pockets around the world, especially in Taiwan and Spain. Technology has a role to play, but the tech is only as good as the political movements that can deploy it in pursuit of progressive demands.
