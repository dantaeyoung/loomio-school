## Invitation

How participants are invited into a facilitated space is incredibly important. People understand huge amounts of information from the invitation, and use it to judge how carefully a space will be held, and if they feel they belong there. The moment of invitation is in many ways the defining opportunity to set the tone and establish trust.

> Decision-making is all about communication: your group can only make good decisions together if there’s a foundation of good communications in place first. This means being clear about what the purpose of a discussion or meeting is, who needs to be involved, what the time-frame is, and what people can expect. — Richard Bartlett

Key aspects to an invitation:

* Background information. What is this thing? What am I being asked to do? Who is behind this? Who else will be involved? What is the time commitment, topic focus, and protocol?
* Context. What is the character of this specific engagement? Of all the possible formats and ways it could go, which one will it be? Why now, why this way?
* Am I welcome? Is this for me? Am I needed in this process? What is my unique value and contribution? Why should I specifically be compelled?
* Is it safe? Does this invitation indicate thoughtfulness, trust, and understanding? Is the structure of the engagement up to handling the inherent power dynamics at play? What level of honesty or vulnerability will this require of me? Do I think the person facilitating/inviting is going to hold me well?
* Is this accessible? Will my basic requirements for participation be accommodated? Language, assistive technology, unfamiliar jargon, etc. Will it be possible for me to engage?

### Translating this into Loomio

* Introduce the idea first through other channels
* Use the custom invite message
* Use the sharable group link
* Use the subdomain
* Use the privacy options
* Use the permissions options
* Accessibility features


## Arrival

The moment of arrival is the "first impression" of an engagement, and sets the trajectory from there on out. At the moment of arrival, the person has accepted an invitation and decided to step in. They are open and expectant, and the impression they get will make a big impact on their experience.

### Welcoming
To enable openness to engagement, participation, and receptivity, a person has to feel welcome. They need their existence acknowledged, and to feel a sense of hospitality.

### Settling
When someone enters a room, they want to know where to sit, where the exit is, where to go to the bathroom, if there is coffee available. They need a basic introduction to the space and their place in it.

### Translating this into Loomio

* The group description fields and discussion context box are the main space to put a "welcome message" for people arriving into the space. The simple fact that we call it a “context box” indicates the awareness of this in the design.
* Use Dashboard, Unread, Notifications, Starred threads, Search
* Take a tour of the Loomio space, tweak things to make yourself comfortable (like notification settings, etc), try out the main features (start a thread, proposal, etc).


## Who’s in the Room

Introducing yourself and being introduced to others is one of the most basic and most important human social functions. From Māori mihimihi to British "how do you do"s to Japanese business card exchanges, every culture places a lot of importance on this. It goes beyond practicalities and politeness and touches on some sort of deep human need, which is a prerequisite for comfort, openness, and focus.

As a facilitator, if you don’t give people a chance to introduce themselves and find out who is around them, and you expect them to talk to one another as a group, they will generally subvert whatever else you’re trying to point their attention at until you allow this process to occur. It’s generally much better to consciously design in introductions as a feature, and use them as an opportunity to further the overall goals of the interaction.

Even among groups who already know each other well, this introduction process continues - this is the basis for "checking in" and other good practices for team cohesion. People wear a constantly shifting multitude of layered identities, which change based on the context of the situation, the phase of an interaction, and who else is involved. People answer and re-answer “who am I for this moment” all the time, and that is what allows people to orient around one another.

A multi-faceted view of someone’s personal context is an essential aspect of interpreting their comments, proposals, and positions in decision-making.

> We start many of our meetings with everyone ‘checking in’ before we get to the agenda. These check-ins are focused not on your work tasks, but on how you’re doing as a human being. If you’re going through a rough patch at home, or you’re sick, or you have exciting positive news, understanding your state of mind will help the entire group have the right context to interpret how you’re communicating. — Richard Bartlett

### Translating this into Loomio

* Introduction threads
* For ‘request to join’ groups, we have a function that allowed the requestor to introduce themselves to the coordinator to get access to the group (but this text is not used in any other way or published to other group members).
* People tend to use their real name on Loomio (usually), and often put up a profile photo - these help people understand a little bit about who someone is.
* Upload profile photos: Photos of faces are one of the most powerful ways of feeling like you know who is in the room with you online.


## Who’s NOT in the Room

Diversity is critical for quality group decision-making. The "wisdom of the crowd effect" often spoken of in regard to collective intelligence, only works by combining a variety of viewpoints. Outcomes of collaboration processes depend heavily on which voices are, and are not, represented. It’s impossible to have perfect representative inclusion, but you need to at least be aware of who might be missing and take it into account. That’s why it’s so important to ask who’s not in the room.

It’s extremely common for people to have blind spots around privilege. Humans are not great at intuiting bias, and a lot better at noticing the presence of something than the absence. Our minds trick us. For example studies show that when women and men are deliberately given an equal amount of talking time, there is often a perception that women are getting more than their fair share. It can be necessary to actually measure or count, instead of relying on intuition.

Someone who does not have certain mobility or accessibility needs may not even notice that a venue isn’t wheelchair accessible, a document isn’t formatted for screen readers, or a situation is excluding someone with hearing loss. This works across many aspects of life, such as someone who doesn’t have kids not thinking that a 7PM meeting time might not work for those who do, or a thousand other practical, social, and cultural elements that could block someone from being in the room.

It’s especially important to think about who is not in room when trying to solve problems for others - build with, not for; talk with people, not about them. If the people you are trying to serve are not in the room, it’s very unlikely you’ll have all the inputs you need to be effective. This is just as much about effectiveness for business outcomes as about social justice - it’s almost always better to design in collaboration with the users or stakeholders.

### Translating this into Loomio

* Collaborating online allows for whole other levels of inclusion, when handled consciously. Instead of thinking about a "digital divide", you can think about the “digital bridge” - technology can allow people who cannot attend in-person meetings to have a voice, lower barriers to participation, and enable whole new possibilities like multi-lingual discussions.
* Loomio makes it very clear who is in a group, and who has participated in a discussion, which gives important information for thinking about inclusion. If people are missing, you can tell.
* Accessibility
* Periodically ask yourself, "who’s not in the room?" Inclusive decision-making is essential to achieve the outcomes you want to get to.


## Culture, Protocol, Expectations

Culture can be quite a nebulous concept, and operates at multiple levels. The culture of the wider society has a big influence, but in a way you can think of every group, and every session or discussion, as having a culture of its own. 

Culture influences protocols and expectations. How do we roll? How do we talk to one another? What is and is not ok here? What are the rules of the game of how we interact? The process of confronting these questions can be a powerful moment of self-awareness for a group, and not confronting them can harm its ability to meet its goals, or sometimes tear apart the group completely.

Culture, protocol, and expectations can be implicit or explicit, and by nature intersect in complex ways with power dynamics and social capital. It’s a challenging balance to keep things loose enough to allow emergence, evolution, creativity, and freedom, while being explicit enough about bottom lines and boundaries to ensure safety.

Facilitators often play the role of guiding the group to live the culture it has set for itself, follow the protocols it has agreed, and hold it to account for the expectations that have been set. If a facilitator is tasked with this role, they need to be backed by a certain level of explicitness about those agreements, and a certain mandate - otherwise it can get messy.

People often want to leave things to "common sense" or “basic decency”, and avoid agreeing a code of conduct or explicit protocols. However, this can disproportionately affect the most vulnerable members of the group, since they will feel the negative impacts of bad behavior or culture first and strongest, and are least empowered to counteract it themselves.

Like a legal contract, you hope you never have to enforce your code of conduct, but if you need it you’re very glad it’s there, and that you agreed it before it became necessary. In short, in order for a facilitator or any member of the group to effectively stand up and say, "that’s not OK here", you need to have invested in culture building and expectation setting.

### Translating this into Loomio

* Because Loomio is used as a space for constructive deliberation, and groups with a specific purpose and set of members are the most common type of users, people for the most part engage in good faith and behave respectfully.
* Loomio is designed specifically to give voice to the individual, and let them communicate their needs and concerns. So even if a majority doesn’t see a problem, a single person can raise it in and at least be noticed.
* Some groups already use the group description field to note a code of conduct or expectations for behavior. Others have collectively agreed a set of expectations that govern participation.
* Communicating online enables a certain level of physical safety, because people are not face to face.
* Many groups use Loomio itself to decide their group protocols, such as how to engage, what is allowed, what a decision means and what makes it valid, etc.
* Some core protocol issues are answered simply by using Loomio in the most basic way - who is allowed here, how do we communicate.
* One of the most basic protocol related decisions Loomio users all encounter is their decision-making protocol - Consensus? Majority? Quorum? Unanimity?
