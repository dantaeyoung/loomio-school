# Commencing

## Invitation

How participants are invited into a facilitated space is incredibly important. People understand huge amounts of information from the invitation, and use it to judge how carefully a space will be held, and if they feel they belong there. The moment of invitation is in many ways the defining opportunity to set the tone and establish trust.

*Decision-making is all about communication: your group can only make good decisions together if there’s a foundation of good communications in place first. This means being clear about what the purpose of a discussion or meeting is, who needs to be involved, what the time-frame is, and what people can expect. -- Richard Bartlett*

Key aspects to an invitation:

* Background information. What is this thing? What am I being asked to do? Who is behind this? Who else will be involved? What is the time commitment, topic focus, and protocol?

* Context. What is the character of this specific engagement? Of all the possible formats and ways it could go, which one will it be? Why now, why this way?

* Am I welcome? Is this for me? Am I needed in this process? What is my unique value and contribution? Why should I specifically be compelled?

* Is it safe? Does this invitation indicate thoughtfulness, trust, and understanding? Is the structure of the engagement up to handling the inherent power dynamics at play? What level of honesty or vulnerability will this require of me? Do I think the person facilitating/inviting is going to hold me well?

* Is this accessible? Will my basic requirements for participation be accommodated? Language, assistive technology, unfamiliar jargon, etc. Will it be possible for me to engage?

Existing Loomio:

* The practicalities behind inviting users to participate on Loomio has been one of our biggest UX and functionality focuses - and remains one of our biggest challenges. 

* We have worked to dramatically lower barriers to accepting the invitation to participate on a practical level - improving the "invite user" process, etc.

* Currently champions often have to introduce people to the idea of Loomio through a separate process, so they are expecting the invitation to join a group.

* Many aspects of Loomio are already designed to create a safe and respectful space users would want to enter - such as thoughtful privacy options.

Areas for Research:

* How can we increase the personalisation and relevance of the invitation experience? How can we bring to the fore the identity of the inviter (presumably known the user), the nature of the invitation (what they are being asked to do) and why they should accept (relevance to what they care about)?

* What can we do to make the job of champion easier, helping them to create better invitations to their group users? How can more of the total invitation job be achieved with the process you go through in Loomio, as opposed to having to prepare users to receive the software invitation separately?

* Could we do more to reassure people about what they are stepping into - such as revealing privacy settings more clearly, and accessibility features?

* How can we give inviters more tools and guidance so they can craft good invitations? 

## Arrival

The moment of arrival is the "first impression" of an engagement, and sets the trajectory from there on out. At the moment of arrival, the person has accepted an invitation and decided to step in. They are open and expectant, and the impression they get will make a big impact on their experience. 

**Welcoming: **To enable openness to engagement, participation, and receptivity, a person has to feel welcome. They need their existence acknowledged, and to feel a sense of hospitality.

**Settling:** When someone enters a room, they want to know where to sit, where the exit is, where to go to the bathroom, if there is coffee available. They need a basic introduction to the space and their place in it.

Existing Loomio:

* We kind of drop people in without much guidance right now, but are working on a better first experience.

* The group description fields and discussion context box are the main space to put a "welcome message" for people arriving into the space. The simple fact that we call it a “context box” indicates the awareness of this in the design.

* We have put a decent amount of work into improving the ability to find what you’re looking for in Loomio, if you know what you’re looking for (the dashboard and unread views, notifications, starred threads, etc).

* The design of Loomio has a gentle "current" that pushes people to take steps like starting discussions, commenting, starting proposals, stating positions, setting outcomes, etc - but much of it is unspoken.

* It’s possible to give yourself a tour of the Loomio space, and tweak things to make yourself comfortable (like notification settings, etc).

Areas for research:

* We could be much more opinionated in our guidance of what actions we want people to take. People feel less anxious when they are held and given strong guidance. It’s the difference between a facilitated process and dropping people into a room for unstructured conversation.

* How can we give people a tour, show them around, and make them feel like they know where they are, and what they are here to do?

* Could the ‘welcoming’ experience into Loomio be more personalised? Can we greet people by name, and connect them to information customised to who they are and what their group is about? For example, leveraging group content for invitation messages, etc.

* How can we better reveal ways users can make the space their own, and the options they have to customise the space to make themselves comfortable? It seems many users are not fully aware of their options around things like email settings, starring threads, the different content views, etc. 

## Who’s in the Room

Introducing yourself and being introduced to others is one of the most basic and most important human social functions. From Māori mihimihi to British "how do you do"s to Japanese business card exchanges, every culture places a lot of importance on this. It goes beyond practicalities and politeness and touches on some sort of deep human need, which is a prerequisite for comfort, openness, and focus.

As a facilitator, if you don’t give people a chance to introduce themselves and find out who is around them, and you expect them to talk to one another as a group, they will generally subvert whatever else you’re trying to point their attention at until you allow this process to occur. It’s generally much better to consciously design in introductions as a feature, and use them as an opportunity to further the overall goals of the interaction.

Even among groups who already know each other well, this introduction process continues - this is the basis for "checking in" and other good practices for team cohesion. People wear a constantly shifting multitude of layered identities, which change based on the context of the situation, the phase of an interaction, and who else is involved. People answer and re-answer “who am I for this moment” all the time, and that is what allows people to orient around one another.

*We start many of our meetings with everyone ‘checking in’ before we get to the agenda. These check-ins are focused not on your work tasks, but on how you’re doing as a human being. If you’re going through a rough patch at home, or you’re sick, or you have exciting positive news, understanding your state of mind will help the entire group have the right context to interpret how you’re communicating. -- Richard Bartlet**t*

Existing Loomio:

* Introduction threads are one of the oldest and longest-standing Loomio "hacks", where people adapt the existing tool to do what they need it to do, even if that’s not how the software has been designed.

* For ‘request to join’ groups, we have a function that allowed the requestor to introduce themselves to the coordinator to get access to the group (but this text is not used in any other way or published to other group members).

* People tend to use their real name on Loomio (usually), and often put up a profile photo - these help people understand a little bit about who someone is.

Areas for research:

* Can we expand the user profile page to make it a more useful tool for people to express themselves and find out more about each other? How can we allow people to vary how they present themselves to different groups, without making users re-write their profile information repeatedly?

* Could introductions be a built-in part of the experience of joining a Loomio group? 

* How can we better support coordinators who are spending lots of time hacking a manual "introductions" process on Loomio already? (Loomio Community and Enspiral are both examples of this).

* How can we improve the experience of a new person joining an existing group and trying to orient themselves around who all these people are? Current introduction threads quickly get hugely long, and it’s not possible to click from someone’s name in another thread to their comment in an introduction thread, even if that content does exist.

* How can we support coordinators who might not be as experienced in facilitation to understand the role and importance of people in a group getting to know a bit about one another? 

* How can our processes acknowledge that a multi-faceted view of someone’s personal context is an essential aspect of interpreting their comments, proposals, and positions in decision-making?

* Can we do more to encourage people to upload profile pictures? Photos of faces are one of the most powerful ways of feeling like you know who is in the room with you online, and it seems that many people who would not be averse to putting up a photo just don’t think of it or realise its importance.

## Who’s NOT in the Room

Diversity is critical for quality group decision-making. The "wisdom of the crowd effect" often spoken of in regard to collective intelligence, only works by combining a variety of viewpoints. Outcomes of collaboration processes depend heavily on which voices are, and are not, represented. It’s impossible to have perfect representative inclusion, but you need to at least be aware of who might be missing and take it into account. That’s why it’s so important to ask who’s not in the room. 

It’s extremely common for people to have blind spots around privilege. Humans are not great at intuiting bias, and a lot better at noticing the presence of something than the absence. Our minds trick us. For example studies show that when women and men are deliberately given an equal amount of talking time, there is often a perception that women are getting more than their fair share. It can be necessary to actually measure or count, instead of relying on intuition. 

Someone who does not have certain mobility or accessibility needs may not even notice that a venue isn’t wheelchair accessible, a document isn’t formatted for screen readers, or a situation is excluding someone with hearing loss. This works across many aspects of life, such as someone who doesn’t have kids not thinking that a 7PM meeting time might not work for those who do, or a thousand other practical, social, and cultural elements that could block someone from being in the room.

It’s especially important to think about who is not in room when trying to solve problems for others - build with, not for; talk with people, not about them. If the people you are trying to serve are not in the room, it’s very unlikely you’ll have all the inputs you need to be effective. This is just as much about effectiveness for business outcomes as about social justice - it’s almost always better to design in collaboration with the users or stakeholders.

Existing Loomio:

* Collaborating online allows for whole other levels of inclusion, when handled consciously. Instead of thinking about a "digital divide", you can think about the “digital bridge” - technology can allow people who cannot attend in-person meetings to have a voice, lower barriers to participation, and enable whole new possibilities like multi-lingual discussions.

* Loomio makes it very clear who is in a group, and who has participated in a discussion, which gives important information for thinking about inclusion. If people are missing, you can tell.

Areas for Research:

* Could Loomio collect demographic information to help groups more objectively measure inclusion?

* How can we encourage people to ask "who’s not in the room", and understand the relationship between inclusion/accessibility and high quality decision outcomes? We should be making the case that inclusion is the right thing for decision-making not just because it’s right, but because it’s essential to achieve the outcomes people want, ie making the right decisions.

* How can Loomio become even more accessible to even more kinds of people?

## Culture, Protocol, Expectations

Culture can be quite a nebulous concept, and operates at multiple levels. The culture of the wider society has a big influence, but in a way you can think of every group, and every session or discussion, as having a culture of its own. 

Culture influences protocols and expectations. How do we roll? How do we talk to one another? What is and is not ok here? What are the rules of the game of how we interact? The process of confronting these questions can be a powerful moment of self-awareness for a group, and not confronting them can harm its ability to meet its goals, or sometimes tear apart the group completely.

Culture, protocol, and expectations can be implicit or explicit, and by nature intersect in complex ways with power dynamics and social capital. It’s a challenging balance to keep things loose enough to allow emergence, evolution, creativity, and freedom, while being explicit enough about bottom lines and boundaries to ensure safety.

Facilitators often play the role of guiding the group to live the culture it has set for itself, follow the protocols it has agreed, and hold it to account for the expectations that have been set. If a facilitator is tasked with this role, they need to be backed by a certain level of explicitness about those agreements, and a certain mandate - otherwise it can get messy.

People often want to leave things to "common sense" or “basic decency”, and avoid agreeing a code of conduct or explicit protocols. However, this can disproportionately affect the most vulnerable members of the group, since they will feel the negative impacts of bad behavior or culture first and strongest, and are least empowered to counteract it themselves. 

Like a legal contract, you hope you never have to enforce your code of conduct, but if you need it you’re very glad it’s there, and that you agreed it before it became necessary. In short, in order for a facilitator or any member of the group to effectively stand up and say, "that’s not OK here", you need to have invested in culture building and expectation setting.

Existing Loomio:

* Because Loomio is marketed and used as a space for constructive deliberation, and groups with a specific purpose and set of members are the most common type of users, people for the most part engage in good faith and behave respectfully.

* Loomio is designed specifically to give voice to the individual, and let them communicate their needs and concerns. So even if a majority doesn’t see a problem, a single person can raise it in and at least be noticed.

* Some groups already use the group description field to note a code of conduct or expectations for behavior. Others have collectively agreed a set of expectations that govern participation.

* Communicating online enables a certain level of physical safety, because people are not face to face. 

* Many groups use Loomio itself to decide their group protocols, such as how to engage, what is allowed, what a decision means and what makes it valid, etc.

* Some core protocol issues are answered simply by using Loomio in the most basic way - who is allowed here, how do we communicate.

Areas for Research:

* Could we support people to be more explicit with their group protocols, and think through things like the culture they want to create, and how they might enforce boundaries and bottom lines?

* Some groups would be served by a Code of Conduct that users have to agree to in order to join. This is especially true for larger groups where people might not know each other personally.

* Anonymity can work both for and against safety, civility, and equality - how do we handle the issue of anonymity in service of helping groups create constructive cultures?

* What do we know about best practice around balancing implicit vs explicit protocols and expectations? When is it good to keep things loser, and when is it good to nail them down? Different kinds of collaborations will require a different approach - there are patterns we could identify and share.

* One of the most basic protocol related decisions Loomio users all encounter is their decision-making protocol - Consensus? Majority? Quorum? Unanimity? We know a lot about the different options people can use, but we don’t share this knowledge or guide people through settling these questions. Loomio enables a departure from traditional methodologies like majority rules or Robert’s Rules of Order, but we do not offer much guidance for understanding the alternatives.
