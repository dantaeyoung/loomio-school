> For every minute of time with the group, consider spending 3 minutes planning. That means spending three hours preparing for a one hour session. Only as you improve should you spend less time planning. — Silvia Zuur

## Understand Purpose

One critical thing a facilitator does in service of a group is to engage with understanding the deeper purpose of the group and the session. Only then can judgement calls be made about how best to serve, what tools to deploy, and what outcomes to aim for. A facilitator cannot progress effectively in their work without this understanding.

Lack of shared understanding about purpose can be fatal to a discussion, or to a group itself. Clarification of purpose is one of the highest value offerings of a skilled facilitator - if they can help the group nail that, everything else is possible. Purpose operates at the level of a group as a whole, and at the level of individual discussions/decisions.

> Always refer back to your purpose-finding questions to check that you’re covering off what the participants want to learn or achieve. — Silvia Zuur

### Translating this into Loomio

* Groups with a clear shared purpose are more successful [...]
* [There is a purpose field, use it...]
* Clarity about purpose can help with several related issues, such as staying on topic, understanding how to participate, gauging when a discussion is done and if it’s been successful, etc

## Rearrange the Furniture

How the space you invite people into is formatted greatly influences the experience and outcomes. Every gathering is unique, and deserves a setup to suit. Changing the layout of a familiar space signals participants to be open to new ideas, and to be present instead of on autopilot.

In offline spaces, literally rearranging the furniture is a habit that helps facilitators get into the right zone to hold space, and prompts them to think about what’s unique in this session. How the furniture is arranged has a big impact on how people interact.

### Translating this into Loomio

* Inviting people into a new digital space specifically for decision-making is powerful - there’s a ‘threshold crossing’ experience, distinct from other online spaces.
* Custom group photo is a prime opportunity to craft a feeling of the space. [Logo too, but subtler.]
* Group purpose, description, and discussion context are the main ‘furniture’ right now, along with the threads you see at the top when you arrive.
* Group description can have images, links, animated gifs...


## Supplies, Tools, Materials

When facilitation is running smoothly, all the pieces a group needs are right at hand. In offline spaces, this stuff like post-its, pens, big paper, name tags, printouts, background material. Every step a facilitator takes to be well-prepared in this way allows more time and energy for the work. Removing stumbling blocks and barriers is a big focus for facilitator prep.

### Translating this into Loomio

* Many groups use the group description and thread context box to link out to other items, like a shared drive of collaborative document, background information, links to project management software.


## Design the Experience

Once they have the basic pieces (purpose, brief, tools, information, general setup), good facilitators take time to think through the design of the experience they are inviting. They consider the nature of the situation, what success could look like, all the possible pathways to get there, and make their choices. They don’t jump in without a considered design.

Time and time again we have seen people drastically underestimated the need for prep and design. Stop and think about the experience you want to hose, before jumping straight in.


### Translating this into Loomio

* Loomio’s most basic functionality follows the structure of good facilitation by design: invite people, start a discussion on a topic, gather divergent input, converge into a specific proposal, test for agreement, confirm outcome. This is the heart of Loomio’s value and success.
* Skilled users are already adapting Loomio for various experience designs - such as a multi-step consultation processes, signing off documents, etc. Each job, when facilitated effectively, takes a certain repeatable shape.
* We have several case studies of thoughtfully designed processes, which could be offered as ‘recipes’.



## Contextualise the Moment

Discussions do not occur in a vacuum, but in the larger context of the group’s history and practice. To be effective, facilitated experiences have to occur with the right timing, and fit in with the rest of the group’s processes and interactions.

Is this a moment of transition? Is this an enhancement of existing practice? Is this one of many concurrent processes, or a singular focus? Are we here to solve a problem, or go deeper, wider, narrower? These are contextual questions that can define the approach.

### Translating this into Loomio

* We already emphasise the role of the ‘champion’, who understands the group’s context and makes the call about whether introducing Loomio is right for them.
* Many groups have successfully integrated Loomio into their existing habits and practices - we can learn from them. Any time Loomio fits nicely into existing workflows, groups will adopt it better.
* What are the signals that a group is ready to incorporate online collaborative practice effectively?
* How can we help users have awareness of their group’s attention economy - when the right time to raise a given topic might be?
* Many groups are not even cognisant of their existing collaborative practice and habits, much less clear about how Loomio might fit in… how do we assist with this self-awareness?
* How can we help users of Loomio build skills for getting the timing right for collaboration interventions (eg, starting a group or discussion)? Facilitators have "spidey senses" for this - can the software be a spidey-helper?


## The Role of the Facilitator

Good facilitation requires quite a bit of self-awareness - on an individual and collective level. Lack of understanding of the nature of the role can lead to misunderstanding, tension, conflict, or unsafe situations.

> Have the power handed over to you. When you’re invited into a new group or organisation, everybody will be thinking: Who’s this joker? Why should we listen to them? Get somebody who the participants know and trust to introduce you. This builds you up in the participants’ minds and helps to hand over the power over to you. — Silvia Zuur

### Consent
It’s critical that the group consents to be facilitated. Attempting to facilitate otherwise can be at worst coercive (unfair to the group), and dangerous (unfair to the facilitator), and will be dragged down by resistance and confusion. Facilitators put themselves in a vulnerable position - they must have mandate or they should not agree to engage.

### Responsibility
Once a facilitator takes up a mandate, they carry enhanced responsibilities, which need to be understood on all sides. Facilitation introduces power differentials - there must be trust and consent. For example, facilitators have more claim to floor time, and directing the group’s attention. This has to be used in service to the whole, not a personal agenda. The words and demeanor of the facilitator will also have a disproportionate effect, meaning they have to act with heightened consideration.

### Power
If the facilitator cannot exercise power in certain ways, they cannot do their job. If the group has given a mandate, for example, for the facilitator to keep a discussion on topic, the facilitator has to be allowed to take acts others might not in the discussion, such as interrupting someone, or saying that a certain way of interacting is not OK. It’s not appropriate to expect a facilitator to shoulder responsibility for the experience without giving them the powers they need to deliver. There is no one right answer about how much power - just that it has to be balanced with the level of responsibility.

### Responsiveness
Facilitators do their best work when they can adapt effectively to the emergent reality. Human beings are endlessly complex, and groups of them exponentially more so. Rigid adherence to a plan or protocol without flexibility will usually set the group up to fail, or at least not succeed as well as it could have. If a facilitator is not allowed or not willing to adapt to changing circumstance, they cannot effectively hold the space.

> Wear and un-wear the facilitation-hat. A challenge many people face is trying to facilitate meetings and workshops with their own team. As a facilitator, they need to be neutral. But as a team member, they have valuable insights to share. Make it really clear when you’re a facilitator and when you’re being a participant. — Silvia Zuur


### Translating this into Loomio

* Many groups using Loomio are experienced with facilitation and already have a shared understanding of the role. They already adapt the tool to meet these needs with some success.
* Often the person who starts a discussion is assumed to be facilitating it, barring another agreed understanding in the group.
* Loomio naturally creates a dynamic open to distributed acts of facilitation, such as users tagging in others, requests to stay on topic, suggestions of the right timing for a proposal, etc (but this often left implicit).
