## Where are we on the Map?

People feel more confident and better held if they can orient themselves within a process or timeline. Facilitators often open a session with an overview of the agenda, and contextualisation of a particular moment within the timeline of a larger process (if relevant). It’s also common to write the agenda/timeline up where everyone can see, to help participants continually understand where they are at a given point in the process.

People want to know what they’re doing now, what’s coming up, and be reminded of what they’ve already done. Understanding the overall shape of the process helps people understand how to contribute effectively - for example if they can see there’s a Q&A section later, they’ll accept an ‘information download’ section without interrupting. If it’s clear that there’s a divergent phase and then a convergent phase, people will be more willing to hold back from jumping to solutions too soon. People need to know what kind of input they are being asked for when, and if they can see how the pieces fit together they will participate more effectively.

Mapping the process well enough to communicate it also challenges facilitators and process designers to fully think through the journey they are inviting people on, and helps them make sure each part of the process has a purpose that builds a cohesive whole. A well facilitated experience follows a logical progression.

### Translating this into Loomio

* A Loomio decision already follows a basic logical progression, which is why it works: Gather (open/invite), Discuss (divergent), Propose (convergent), Decide and Act (conclude).
* Many Loomio users are employing the tool as part of explicitly mapped experiences, such as a multi-stage consultation process. Experienced facilitators are able to work it into their existing practice with some success.
* We offer some tools of facilitators to help "reveal the map" to users, such as the group description field, and proposal deadlines.


## The Art of Noticing

Noticing is probably the most critical facilitation skill of all. The facilitator uses the art of noticing to figure out what interventions or responses are needed, how to invite the right contributions, and to help the group notice what’s going on with individuals and the whole. The value of facilitation really stems from having someone specifically paying attention and acting on what they notice, while others may be focused on specific content, their own agendas, etc.

The informational inputs, and the ability to interpret and act on them, make all the difference. Many facilitators talk about "reading" a room. What are they “reading”? It’s everything from emotional reactions, to tensions, to power dynamics. To do this effectively, they need information and signalling systems.

### Translating this into Loomio

* Many current features assist with noticing - the biggest one is probably statements of positions on proposals and how the pie is shaping up. But also other information like who has and has not yet participated, what topics are being raised, who has and has not accepted their group invitation, etc are also helpful.
* In some ways Loomio makes it much easier to practice noticing and make interventions in response - a single facilitator can read across dozens of discussions at the same time, see clearly what’s being shared, and act accordingly. Talking online can make much of what is implicit in person explicit, and therefore easier to notice.
* Communicating in writing can be very good for naming what’s being noticed and why a certain action is being taken in response. For example, you can quote someone’s exact words and reflect back what’s revealed by them. Or you can do the same thing at the level of a whole discussion, picking out a range of quotes and noticing themes or emerging conflicts, etc.
* Noticing is much easier when you slow things down, which is one of Loomio’s great advantages - asynchronous communication you can read at any pace. It also makes it possible to notice across time, referring directly to past discussions.


## Hearing Diverse Voices

In our society, multiple layers of history, power dynamics, culture, and psychology conspire to amplify certain voices and suppress others. This plays out at every level of experience, from our innermost subconscious beliefs to our political system and laws, and everything in between. But the best ideas and important information does not always come from the loudest voices: the role of facilitation is to counteract these biases. It’s a big concept to take on all of society’s baggage, but it’s important to be aware of the dynamics we are collectively grappling with if our goal is social justice, group effectiveness, and high quality decision-making.

> If you want to innovate, you have to make space for different points of view — luckily, this is also what you need to do if you want a team where everyone is empowered. All kinds of cultural and technical factors conspire to privilege some voices at the expense of others. There are many practices you can implement to systematically challenge that bias, but just being aware of it is a good starting point. — Richard Bartlett

Perhaps due to the universal lived human experience of inhabiting a singular consciousness, humans tend to forget that others don’t actually think or experience the world like they do. Even within a seemingly very homogenous group of people, there is incredible diversity - perspectives, communication styles, pace, preferences. Internalising this truth is a central personal growth challenge for many facilitators.

There is no such thing as one size fits all - any mode of interacting enhances some voices and quiets others, or emphasises different tendencies within an individual. So it’s necessary to employ a range of approaches and modes if the goal is to invite the best from multiple diverse voices.

<img src="img/silvia_200.png" class="img-right img-100px"/>

> Check you’re catering to different learning styles. One simple way to check is with the Head, Heart, Hands metaphor. People who learn with their Head need facts and detailed information. A Heart learner thrives off stories. They need an emotional connection to the work. Learning with the Hands is all about doing stuff and getting active. — Silvia Zuur

One of the best approaches to bringing out and weaving together diverse voices is to invite diverse modes of interaction, which will serve different needs and preferences, and level the communication playing field.

Some classic design building blocks to address communication diversity in collaborative communication:

* **Group size** - individual reflection, pairs, small group, large group, one-to-one, one-to-many, many-to-many
* **Medium of expression** - writing, drawing, video, singing, dance, flowcharts, equations, symbols, stories, tears, laughter, debate, etc.
* **Discussion protocols** - rounds (hear from each person once before moving on), rate limiting (you can only speak again after two others have spoken), talking stick (only speak when you have the stick - no interrupting), time-limited contributions (you can talk for 1 minute only), time-unlimited contributions (you can hold the floor indefinitely and everyone will deeply listen), tracking contributions (how much have women vs men spoken, etc), holding periods of silence between speakers.
* **Embrace silence.** Silence is only awkward if you let it be awkward. Silence is a chance for people to think. — Silvia Zuur

### Translating this into Loomio

* The design of Loomio has always been about ‘hearing all voices’, including people who aren’t able to be there in person, are quieter, are busy, etc. This is a big part of our core value proposition, and the simple facts of asynchronous written communication go a long way toward it. In text, every voice is more or less the same "volume".
* The proposal feature is essentially a "round", assisting groups to facilitate each individual person having their say (if they want to), on an equal basis with all the other participants.
* Loomio enables multi-media, including links to videos, images, diagrams, supporting evidence etc, which serves various communication styles.
* With active facilitation and group maturity, it is possible to employ discussion protocols "manually" (eg, just agree to not post another comment until others have contributed, etc)...
* Users have created different group sizes using parent groups and subgroups, and some large consultation processes have involved multiple smaller groups which are then synthesised into a larger outcome.
* It’s common for people who work best using individual reflection to take time out and process their thoughts, and then come back and share a longer comment or link to a document. This is a "self-selecting" example of creating interplay between individual and group communication.
* Loomio accessibility features and multi-lingual translations make it possible for people with very different needs to participate as equals in one discussion. This is a key example of how technology can enable equitable participation in a way that’s nearly impossible in person.
* If someone is contributing more than their share (talking too much), it’s technically possible to just scroll on by (whereas in person this behaviour can totally dominate the interaction and requires much more proactive interventions to counteract). However, in practice, people posting ‘walls of text’ can still be detrimental to a balanced Loomio discussion.


## Counter Cognitive Bias

Human brains have evolved over millions of years to try to balance quick, efficient ‘good enough’ thinking with slow, expensive, deep analysis. Most of the time, this works pretty well, and allows us to get it right using instincts, heuristics, and generalisations. But other times, we get it wrong. In fact, there are well-known "bugs" in the human thought program, which can trip people up and keep them from making the best decisions. This is further complicated in group situations. To make good decisions, we need to have awareness of these dynamics.

There is a huge [range of cognitive biases](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_cognitive_biases) (this list is really worth a read), all of which have potential impacts on decision-making and collaboration. Facilitation can be an important tool to deal with them, to raise awareness of their existence, encourage proactive choices about them (eg, when is it more important to move quickly and when is it more important to be accurate), and employ tools to reveal or counteract them.

One powerful tool to counter cognitive bias and increase quality of decisions is structured processes and communication. Processes can be designed to counter cognitive errors specifically, but just the simple challenge of following a process instead of the "path of least resistance" for one’s brain can help highlight thinking errors and bias. This can put the facilitator in the position of pushing the group to do things that feel challenging or trigger resistance, precisely because their brains are being asked to step out of familiar patterns. But some discipline in this area can help groups achieve their deeper goals, which many participants will agree is worth some temporary discomfort.

Some examples of processes that can help mitigate cognitive bias:

* [De Bono’s Hats](http://www.debonoforschools.com/asp/six_hats.asp): different colored hats participants can wear (metaphorically) to step outside their own opinions and try on different modes of thinking and input.
* Checklists: thinking ‘ruts’ can cause us to miss even obvious things, so a checklist of aspects to consider or process points can be helpful to weed out errors.
* The Five Why’s: only asking why once or twice can mislead you that you’ve reached the conclusion before you get to the root level of the issue.
* Mental models: exercises like SWOT analysis, business canvases or other structured information gathering exercises can guide you to think of all aspects of an issue.

### Translating this into Loomio

* Getting more diverse information and inputs to possibly disrupt assumptions or bias is built into Loomio’s basic design, by enabling more voices to contribute to a discussion on a more equitable basis.
* Loomio has powerful tools that help counter groupthink, namely the ability to dissent constructively. Safe and valued dissent is essential for a culture of critical thinking.
* Communicating asynchronously in writing slows conversation down and lets it be more carefully considered - this is a key advantage Loomio has over other modes of communication.
* Loomio already invites people into a semi-structured process that leads them to more considered decision-making than totally unstructured communication. People feel the difference and it’s a key aspect to the value they get from the tool (even if they are not aware where this effect is coming from in the design).


## Balancing Divergent / Convergent

The ‘diamond’ of divergence and convergence is a conversational shape that expands outward at first - opening up space for ideas, information, and different perspectives - then begins to come to a point, narrowing down to a specific conclusion. The right timing for this shift, and making sure the shift occurs, is key for effective facilitation of action-oriented discussion. The rhythm of this process is the nature of productive collaboration (where people work together to synthesise new solutions).

If divergence is missed out or cut off too early, there will be a lack of information to work with, people may not feel heard, and great ideas will be left unsaid. If convergence is missed out or left too late, discussion can continue indefinitely without reaching an actionable conclusion, burning participants energy and failing to achieve results.

The phases of each can be further broken down: divergence consists of introduction, clarification, ideation, etc, and convergence consists of analysis, conclusion, commitment, etc. Each sub-phase of the larger process also requires awareness of the right timing and intervention. Some discussions succeed with only a vague nod toward the diamond, while others are served by a meticulous breakdown of each phase and sub-phase.

Within a group, different individuals will usually tend to prefer one mode or the other, and the group as a whole will have collective tendencies toward too much blue sky thinking, jumping to solutions, or other ways the diamond can be unbalanced. Facilitation can help each person and the group as a whole spend the right amount of energy on the different modes.


### Translating this into Loomio

* The core Loomio process does an excellent job of guiding groups to touch on each phase of the process, with the discussion being divergent and proposals being convergent. Awareness of the diamond was a big inspiration for the original design of the Loomio process.
* Loomio helps groups to use the diamond in dynamic ways, such as when an attempt to converge (a proposal) ends up becoming a deeper level of divergence (disagreement), revealing or clarifying information to support an even better convergence (iterated proposal).
* Some of Loomio’s basic features go a long way toward supporting each mode, such as notifications to group members when a new discussion is starting (prompting divergent contribution), and deadlines on proposals.
* Loomio users are already able to use the existing feature set to facilitate convergence - namely starting a proposal. Good use of proposals is one of the most obvious symptoms of an effective Loomio group, and simply advising users to start more proposals unblocks many groups who are having issues.


## Working with Scope

Successful collaboration often depends on biting off the right size piece, and biting them off in a effective order. You can apply a ‘project management’ mindset to facilitation, designing for questions like: What are the dependencies (what’s the critical path, which things need to be done first to enable other things)? What’s the most important bits to focus on? What is an achievable scope to tackle at a given time to get to a useful place with the time, energy, and information available?

It’s important not to try to "boil the ocean", and instead break things down into manageable chunks. You can build toward a bigger outcome in a series of smaller pieces. It’s often better to achieve something small but useful - building trust, confidence, and energy - than to fail to reach any conclusions by aiming too large. It’s also possible to get too bogged down in details and fail to hit the bigger issues, so hitting the right scope is a balance.

One useful technique is "a series of small yeses". Lumping too many conversations together simply creates confusion. Frustrated groups are often helped by breaking things down and taking them on in pieces. If an issue seems hopeless complex or conflicted, it can be possible to separate out individual questions and reach consensus on them, starting with the aspect that already have agreement. Then when it comes to points of disagreement, you can pare it down to only the crux of the issues and work on them in a focused way.

Managing scope is a dynamic process. The point of collaboration and discussion is that no one knows going on exactly what will emerge - so scope must evolve with the discussion. Whether a conversation branching out is seen as a distraction or an evolution of thinking is a judgement call. Too much rigidity and too much flexibility can both be damaging. Often times it’s not about whether something is relevant or not relevant, but a question of sequence and timing in terms of what will be most constructive.

*If you plan a session with multiple, interlinked parts – each one building on the other, and all leading to a life-changing, mind-exploding conclusion – and you can pull it off, then that’s amazing. But more often than not, a complicated session will go over-time and may not hit the participant’s wants and needs. -- Silvia Zuur*

### Translating this into Loomio

* Topic-based discussion threads are a powerful tool for effective scope - even more than face-to-face conversation, Loomio discussions can be usefully delineated to encourage focus on a specific question or part of a problem, while other aspects can be addressed simultaneously in other threads.

* The fact that Loomio is group-based does a lot of the work to define "who are we, and what are we here to discuss (or not)". This helps participants self-select what topics to bring up effectively. 

* In practice, we often see users making facilitation interventions like "That’s out of the scope of this topic, but why don’t you start a new discussion about it?"

* The sequential proposals design of Loomio is very good for a "series of small yesses" approach - you can build small agreements while maintaining focus and context of a single discussion thread, and see the history of previous proposals to build on.

Areas for Research:

* Could we allow Loomio discussions to be branched and merged, to achieve the right scope as information emerges?

* Could we help groups to better define and express their purpose, to help participants scope their communication accordingly?

* Could we better support people to use the discussion context to aim for the right scope? How a discussion is framed can be an important factor in successful scoping. Could users be better supported to help the discussion context evolve with the discussion to keep the scope clear?

* What can we do to better support group facilitators to design the right scope for a given discussion or group? We often see users getting it wrong, either smushing too much into one discussion or group, or trying to break it down into too many tiny pieces. We do know best practice for things like balancing openness and specificity in discussion topics, and when and how to introduce topic subgroups, but we don’t communicate this knowledge well.

## Pacing and Timing

A productive conversation has a rhythm. The right beat comes from the complex combination of the different people, inputs, and circumstances, and often feels intuitive, like a musician. When is the moment to go deeper, or pull back? When is it right to bring in new information, or further delve into what’s already on the table? 

Different participants will have different needs and preferences - some will need reigning in, while others need pulling along. The right pace emerges when a creative tension between digging deeper and moving forward is found. When it’s off in either direction, people will feel frustrated - either impatient or left behind.

### Translating this into Loomio

* Loomio provides a decent platform for a pace that suits the group to emerge, even without proactive facilitation. Because it’s asynchronous, people can read and respond at their own pace. 

* It’s also possible to scroll right past people moving slowly and push for forward momentum, and simultaneously possible to continue digging into something slowly while others press forward. This is a special ability not possible in synchronous communication.

* Groups have been seen to quite effectively figure out their own speed for setting proposal deadlines. Groups/topics that need to move quickly use shorter timeframes, and longer ones when appropriate to the decision. Users seem to fairly intuitively grasp that different decisions can go at different speeds and act accordingly.

* It’s easy to "hop on and off the train" to modulate your own pace of engagement. For example, if a conversation is moving too fast or slowly for you, you can drop your input and step back, and then return later when a proposal is raised to state your position.

* It’s interesting to note how a "fast" decision on Loomio is 1 or 2 days, while a “fast” decision in person is more like 5 minutes. And yet, Loomio does not seem “slow” (the way taking 2 days to reach a decision in person would). This is probably because of the ability to run Loomio decision in parallel to other ongoing work (multi-channel parallel processing), and because it’s so much more efficient gathering everyone’s input on Loomio over 2 days versus having to schedule an in-person meeting.

* Facilitation on Loomio could be likened to "bullet time" (when Neo can stop time and just walk around a bullet in the Matrix) - you can walk through a living conversation frame by frame. It’s like a superpower, but we don’t really articulate it.

Areas for research:

* Proposals are probably the most effective tool in Loomio for pacing. How can we support users to time them well? What do we know about the timing of proposals that leads to clear outcomes?

* Could the UX better support people working at different paces to collaborate together well? For example, could a small subset of the group go deep or fast on an aspect of the discussion without overwhelming the main flow, and then feed back in what they learned? Discussion threading could help a lot with this - the top level comments would be going at once pace, with the sub-comments at another, without interference.

* Could we do a better job helping people "catch up" if they find themselves behind the pace of a discussion? For example, discussion summaries that help you get up to speed so the group can continue the momentum while being inclusive.

* How can we think about the value of "slowing down" communication? Slowing things down can be incredibly helpful for gaining deep understanding and doing your best thinking, and asynchronous written discussion is a unique opportunity to go for quality over speed while still overall achieving efficiency.

* What do we know about the right timeframe for different kinds of decisions, and could we share that understanding with users? There are many variables, such as complexity of the topic, size of the group, and external deadlines or constraints - can we help users think through when to push forward and when to leave more space?


## Managing the Attention Economy

A facilitator is a curator of attention. In collaboration and knowledge-work problem solving, the information available can be literally infinite. It becomes critical to filter it in order to avoid overwhelm. Managing the attention economy means balancing importance to the goals against time and capacity available.

Facilitation can assist with productively shaping the attention economy in a range of ways. One is to help the group to agree what the purpose and scope of a given discussion or process is, and then guide them to stay focused on it. Limiting distractions and steering the conversation back on track are common interventions.

Another important way facilitators work with attention is to insist on the group holding it long enough. When things get challenging, unclear, or uncomfortable, it’s common for people to want to give up too soon, deflect to another topic, or look away. A facilitator can play a critical role in helping the group see things through or fully process them in service of their goals.

Structured processes and information sorting exercises are important facilitation tools in this area. Some examples:

* Time-boxing a period of brainstorming, to let out all kinds of ideas and information, and then focusing down on a few.
* Listing everything people might want to talk about in the agenda, and then running a process to prioritise the top items to focus on first.
* Generating a bunch of concepts on post-its and grouping them into thematic clouds, which are then condensed into topics.
* Having a "parking lot" space to stick ideas or questions that come up that are not immediately relevant, to be addressed later.
* Defining success criteria for process, and keeping the group focused on it until those criteria are achieved.

### Translating this into Loomio

* One of the most important attention management features in Loomio is topic-based discussion threading. There’s a reason why this format was one of the first to emerge in online communication decades ago, and continues to be used widely today - it’s a highly effective way to sort attention. Most Loomio users intuitively understand how to stay on topic when it’s listed in big letters at the top of the page.
* Activity in Loomio is like the currency of its attention economy - everything that generates a notification spends it. We have honed our understanding about what should be considered "salient" activity over the years (for example, comments, votes, and outcomes are, while a ‘like’ on a comment is not). We have settled on specific default settings for notifications through trial and error and a lot of user feedback.
* Users can exercise a lot of customised control over their Loomio attention economy through notification settings.
* Subgroups can be a powerful tool to help people moderate their attention economy.
* The intentional but somewhat unpopular design decision to disallow concurrent proposals in Loomio is about the flow of attention - holding a group’s ‘feet to the fire’ so to speak to fully process a proposal before moving on is a powerful way to shake out issues and clarify the landscape of the group’s views.

> Many designers of information systems incorrectly represented their design problem as information scarcity rather than attention scarcity, and as a result they built systems that excelled at providing more and more information to people, when what was really needed were systems that excelled at filtering out unimportant or irrelevant information. — **[Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attention_economy)



## Facilitation Interventions

There are as many facilitation techniques as there are facilitators in the world, and entire libraries books have been written on the topic. It’s not possible to provide a list of interventions. However, it might be useful to consider two categories of interventions.

1. Supportive interventions: inviting contribution, going deeper, drawing out, coaxing, nurturing, protecting, creating space
2. Assertive interventions: pulling back, shutting down, drawing lines, interrupting, challenging, steering on course, excluding bad behavior

> Singling people out for a contribution will just make them feel like the stupid kid in class who doesn’t know the answer. Instead, a general invite to people who haven’t spoken yet to contribute tells the regular contributors to stay quiet, and gives quieter people the opportunity to step forward. — Silvia Zuur

Almost all interventions in face-to-face facilitation can be reimagined and employed in the online space.

### Translating this into Loomio

* The main tools Loomio offers currently for making interventions are comments, @mentions, adding/removing users, and deleting comments/discussions. These can be employed for various forms of supportive and assertive interventions. The most commonly used is probably comments - simply talking to the group and inviting or trying to reduce certain behavior.
* Participation permissions offer relatively blunt but effective tools to moderate users, such as allowing or disallowing posting discussions or proposals, etc.
* Loomio offers some trust-based features that other tools lack, such as the ability for all participants to edit discussion contexts (even if it was posted originally by another user). These ideas are inspired by things like Wikipedia and open source software development.
