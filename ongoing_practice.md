# Ongoing Practice

## Continuous Improvement

No matter how amazing a group or facilitator is, they can always improve. And no matter where they are starting, if they incrementally head in a good direction, they will get to a better place. If a group has an effective protocol to have a meta-conversation about how they collaborate, then anything is possible. Without that, it will stagnate.

There are many approaches to continuous improvement, but they all create space for reflection and feedback, and a way to make changes in response. For teams that work together on an ongoing basis, they might employ a methodology like agile, including retrospectives and process improvement. For a one-off session a facilitator might simply follow up with a request for feedback to improve for next time.

Existing Loomio:

* People already use Loomio itself to talk about how they use Loomio. It provides an obvious platform to talk about the talking. 

* The process of joining Loomio causes groups to reflect on many aspects of their collaboration and decision-making process, which creates the opportunity to improve it.

Areas for Research:

* Could we provide a better roadmap of "basic" Loomio use, and then more “advanced” use that we’ve seen succeed, so users evolving their practice wouldn’t need to reinvent the wheel?

* Are there especially powerful trigger points that can be learning moments for group reflection, and could we intervene and support it? For example, the first time a proposal fails. 

* A plugin library could be a marketplace of process improvements that new groups could adopt. How can we apply facilitation expertise to its curation?

* How can we help groups who might not be having meta-conversations about how they want to work together, or a safe space to talk about what could be better? Can we give support to people who feel disempowered, like there’s not a way for their concerns to be heard in their group? 

## Distributed Facilitation / Self-facilitation 

As a group becomes more experienced with collaboration, more individuals in it build capacity for facilitation. Facilitation can cease to be a role held by a specific person, and become more of a function that can be distributed around the group. In a peer-facilitation environment, anyone can take acts of facilitation, and a dance of give and take, leading and following, emerges among the participants. For groups with aspirations toward shared leadership and non-hierarchy, this is a very important thing to encourage. 

People who are less used to taking acts of facilitation can be supported with education, invitations, and suggestions of first steps. Some examples of acts of facilitation almost anyone can be encouraged to try: reflecting back what you’re hearing or summarising, inviting others to contribute, asking questions to enhance collective understanding, noticing who is and is not participating, appreciating other’s contributions explicitly. 

*You don’t need an agenda to be a facilitator. Facilitating is just about making a group situation easy. Next time you’re at a family gathering, party or morning tea: approach it like a facilitator and make sure everybody in the group feels included and able to participate. 
-- Silvia Zuur*

Distributed facilitation can work beautifully - and it can also cause people to step all over each other. At first, it’s almost always awkward as people learn the dance. It’s important to differentiate between distributed facilitation (peers helping the collective succeed in collaboration), facipulation (using acts of facilitation to further your own agenda), and backseat facilitation (taking acts of facilitation when you do not have the mandate - such as when a specific facilitator has been named for a reason). 

It’s important to consciously decide when peer facilitation is a good choice, and when a specific facilitator is called for. In certain situations, such as a high-conflict discussion where a specified neutral party is needed, or there is a lack of trust, distributed facilitation might not work.

*Acts of facilitation are not just for the manager, or the person who called the meeting — they are for everyone. -- Richard Bartlett*

Existing Loomio:

* The online space is uniquely suited to distributed facilitation in many ways. Different people can come along at different points and contribute acts of facilitation, depending on what they notice and their skill set. An online discussion is by default a distributed collaboration among peers.

* Loomio is designed with a group of equals in mind. In many ways, a distributed facilitation approach is the best fit for our tool.

* Current Loomio users do peer facilitation all the time, whether they realise that’s what they are doing or not. Simple things like suggesting someone raise a proposal, tagging people in, summarising the process so far, etc, are all acts of facilitation.

Areas for Research:

* How can we provide guidance or balance about when distributed facilitation is a good approach, and when naming a facilitator might be better?

* Could we reveal that people already are taking acts of facilitation, and help them to understand what they are doing and how they might do more of it? Could we offer more education and encouragement?

## The Art of Being Facilitated

Like the skill of being the follow in a ballroom dance pair, being facilitated is an art unto itself. People with experience facilitating themselves, or who have participated in a lot of well-facilitated processes will receive facilitation differently than those who aren’t familiar or who don’t value it. 

On the positive side, skillful receptivity to facilitation can have a big impact on group success. This ranges from things as simple as showing up on time, to following instructions, to being willing to try a new style of thinking or communicating. Sometimes people have a good experience and they don’t quite know why - pointing out that facilitation is the reason for the smoothness or depth can help them understand what it is they valued about the process.

On the negative side, people who can’t or won’t be facilitated can be detrimental to group collaboration. No matter how skilled a facilitator is, if they encounter a certain level of resistance they won’t be able to do their job. Common problems include dominating the discussion, playing devil’s advocate, disrupting the process, disrespecting the facilitator or participants, or being disengaged.

Existing Loomio:

* With a little practice, most users quickly upskill on being responsive to acts of facilitation on Loomio, such as replying when @mentioned

* The ease of taking acts of facilitation on Loomio helps people become more responsive themselves

Areas for Research:

* We don’t have many tools in place for when a participant is not being receptive to facilitation. A single bad actor could wreak havoc through malicious intent, or even just low self-awareness or EQ.

* Could we offer tools to help people be more aware of facilitation, learn to value it, and get better at responding to it? This is the precursor step to learning to take acts of facilitation themselves.

## Culture Change 

A collaborative, participatory culture is something that emerges over time, with lots of practice and trial and error. Understanding, valuing, and inviting facilitation can play a pivotal role in this cultural emergence. Facilitation can evolve from a role, to a function, to a mindset. A truly collaborative culture is one where everyone is facilitating everyone in myriad different ways. 

When the culture of collaboration starts to leak out of specific "collaboration" spaces, and starts to show up in every aspect of the organisation, that’s when culture change is emerging. Is the company party participatory? Does the office potluck just happen like magic? Are ideas able to emerge from anywhere, evolve through many brains and hands, and be implemented in a way better than anyone first imagined? Collaboration is not about post-it notes and check-ins, but the timbre of organisational life.

Existing Loomio:

* The theory of change of Loomio is that more groups practicing effective, inclusive decision-making can change organisational dynamics at a global scale. This shows up in everything about how the tool is designed. Ultimately, it’s about culture change through collaborative practice.

* We have observed Loomio groups experiencing the lived reality of evolving culture through using the tool. Often times, it looks like a group that already has a collaborative culture being about to scale while holding onto it, or a group that has aspirations of being participatory continuing to exists instead of imploding.

* Loomio makes a certain kind of "new normal" of collaborative practice possible, not through any complicated technology, but through making best practice of simple collaborative practice more accessible and achievable. 

Areas for Research:

* How do we tell the stories of collaborative culture change in a compelling way? The world is hungry for them. How can we see those connections between what people use Loomio for, and what they’re doing in other aspects of how they interact?

* Many, many people have aspirations to work collaboratively, but fail because they don’t know how. What is our role in helping them?

* How can we measure or visualise culture change through Loomio? Data about how a group interacts over time seems like a powerful source of learning, but we haven’t really tapped that for our own learning, or revealed their own culture change to groups.

* How do we know when culture change is actually happening? Are there tell-tale signs? Do we know what can catalyse it?
