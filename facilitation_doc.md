# Facilitation in the Loomio Context

## Introduction

There are many inputs to thinking about the Loomio product (the broader conception of the product as the software, documentation/training, and overall user experience), including user feedback, market demand, and technical expertise. This document is intended to be a reference framework for the input channel defined by facilitation expertise. 

*If we begin thinking from facilitation first principles and best practice, and interpret it in the Loomio context of an online tool, what can we learn?*

Whether it’s being employed by a professional facilitator explicitly in that role, or people peer-facilitating each other, or a group that has no awareness of facilitation at all, Loomio’s essential function is to mediate and support group communication and interaction toward a desired outcome. This is facilitation. 

Loomio is groupware. This is a term with a specific meaning:

*Collaborative software or groupware is an application software designed to help people involved in a common task to achieve their goals. One of the earliest definitions of collaborative software is 'intentional group processes plus software to support them.'*

Groupware is essentially about interpreting facilitation into software. This is the heart of what we’re here to do with Loomio. We need to understand our product’s identity as groupware, and think deeply about the intersection of traditional facilitation - what we can learn from generations who have come before us - and emerging future possibilities enabled by communication in the online space.

There is a huge body of knowledge, best practice, and tradition in both in-person facilitation and online moderation - but the art and science of their intersection is only just emerging. This is the specific space in which Loomio should work to be a world class product.

## Big-picture Vision Questions

* How might we design Loomio so users feel like they are working with an experienced facilitator, even if they don’t have one in their group? 

* How might the Loomio software itself provide a facilitated experience, when each user has slightly different needs? 

* How might Loomio be a tool that working facilitators can use to go much further in what they can achieve, taking the craft itself to a new level?

## About this Document

This is not a narrative, but a reference. It’s intended to be used as a jumping off point for further research, and a place to check when delving into problem-solving in Loomio design. The current state of this document is not intended to be final - ideally this would be a living document that others could work with, add to, and extend.

Each section follows the same format: an explication of one aspect of facilitation, followed by an analysis of how it works in the existing Loomio design, and a range of suggestions for future research. 

You will not find a specific argument for prioritising one solution over another, just a jumping off point for asking more questions. Some possible solutions will relate to software features, others to documentation or help resources, and others simply to deepening our internal understanding and awareness as we make decisions about the product. Think of it as a Roadmap of Questions.

You will also notice a lot of redundancy in the text. The same ideas crop up several times in different areas. This is because this document attempts to look at the same issues through a variety of lenses.

## Author’s Note

I am not a seminal facilitation expert. I consider myself only a beginner, in a craft which one can spend a lifetime honing. I am also only one person with one perspective and approach to facilitation. I do not claim to be any kind of definitive source. What I can offer is help translating between the offline and online spaces, as a practitioner in both. 

If I am making an argument here, it’s that giving users what they think they want, what feels "easiest" to them, is not the whole story of providing value. If people already knew exactly what to do, they would not need our help. They are looking to us to provide a certain level of guidance, a certain degree of opinionatedness in the experience we invite them into. In other words, to facilitate them. 

# Preparation

*For every minute of time with the group, consider spending 3 minutes planning. That means spending three hours preparing for a one hour session. Only as you improve should you spend less time planning. - Silvia Zuur*

## Understand Purpose

One critical thing a facilitator does in service of a group is to engage with understanding the deeper purpose of the group and the session. Only then can judgement calls be made about how best to serve, what tools to deploy, and what outcomes to aim for. A facilitator cannot progress effectively in their work without this understanding.

Lack of shared understanding about purpose can be fatal to a discussion, or to a group itself. Clarification of purpose is one of the highest value offerings of a skilled facilitator - if they can help the group nail that, everything else is possible. Purpose operates at the level of a group as a whole, and at the level of individual discussions/decisions.

*Always refer back to your purpose-finding questions to check that you’re covering off what the participants want to learn or achieve. -- Silvia Zuur*

Existing Loomio:

* We know that groups with a clear shared purpose are more successful, and emphasise this in our help documentation and the stories of groups we share.

* We offer some spaces for explication of purpose, such as the group description and discussion context fields.

Areas for Research:

* Could we more explicitly assist groups to define their purpose? Or the purpose of a specific discussion or decision?

* Clarity about purpose can help with several related issues, such as staying on topic, understanding how to participate, gauging when a discussion is done and if it’s been successful, etc - how can our software enhance user understanding of these aspects?

## Rearrange the Furniture

How the space you invite people into is formatted greatly influences the experience and outcomes. Every gathering is unique, and deserves a setup to suit. Changing the layout of a familiar space signals participants to be open to new ideas, and to be present instead of on autopilot. 

In offline spaces, literally rearranging the furniture is a habit that helps facilitators get into the right zone to hold space, and prompts them to think about what’s unique in this session. How the furniture is arranged has a big impact on how people interact.

Existing Loomio:

* Inviting people into a new digital space specifically for decision-making is powerful - there’s a ‘threshold crossing’ experience, distinct from other online spaces.

* Custom group photo is a prime opportunity to craft a feeling of the space.

* Group description and discussion context are the main ‘furniture’ right now, along with the threads you see at the top when you arrive.

Areas for Research:

* How can we help users make better use of existing tools for making their Loomio space their own?

* How can we give coordinators new tools for customising and designing their Loomio space? What should be nailed to the floor, and what should be moveable? (For example, pinning a thread to the top of a group.)

* People may not be conscious of the impact of entering a space for decision-making. Could it be more explicit? Example: agree to a context-setting welcome message upon joining.

## Supplies, Tools, Materials

When facilitation is running smoothly, all the pieces a group needs are right at hand. In offline spaces, this stuff like post-its, pens, big paper, name tags, printouts, background material. Every step a facilitator takes to be well-prepared in this way allows more time and energy for the work. Removing stumbling blocks and barriers is a big focus for facilitator prep.

Existing Loomio:

* Many groups use the group description and context box to link out to other items, like a shared drive of collaborative document, background information, etc.

Areas for Research:

* Can Loomio interface more easily with other complementary tools, like Doodle, Trello, Google Docs, Calendars? This could be software integration, or just training on how to use tools together.

* Could we be a lot more explicit in directing coordinators to make necessary tasks easier on their users, so people don’t get caught up in annoying practicalities and spend their energy on decision-making?

* Many people don’t find using multi-media in Loomio to be user friendly - this makes deploying needed tools harder (links, images, video, etc).

* Can we be a lot more explicit when people start discussions - for example, warnings to include all relevant background material, etc?

* A tab or area on the group page or discussion page for links, attachments, shared documents, related tools the group uses, etc. 

## Design the Experience

Once they have the basic pieces (purpose, brief, tools, information, general setup), good facilitators take time to think through the design of the experience they are inviting. They consider the nature of the situation, what success could look like, all the possible pathways to get there, and make their choices. They don’t jump in without a considered design.

Existing Loomio:

* Loomio’s most basic functionality follows the structure of good facilitation by design: invite people, start a discussion on a topic, gather divergent input, converge into a specific proposal, test for agreement, confirm outcome. This is the heart of Loomio’s value and success.

* Skilled users are already adapting Loomio for various experience designs - such as a multi-step consultation processes, signing off documents, etc. Each job, when facilitated effectively, takes a certain repeatable shape.

* We have several case studies of thoughtfully designed processes, which could be offered as ‘recipes’.

Areas for Research:

* How can we enable those less experienced with facilitation to follow well-designed processes? Can we give them recipes or templates? Training?

* Can we more explicitly reveal the ‘secret sauce’ of the core Loomio process, so people understand what’s happening and why it works, and how they might want to adapt it or troubleshoot it?

* How can we encourage users to stop and think through the design of the experience they want to host, before jumping straight in? Some of our consulting clients have drastically underestimated the need for prep and design, and it seems like a common issue.

## Contextualise the Moment

Discussions do not occur in a vacuum, but in the larger context of the group’s history and practice. To be effective, facilitated experiences have to occur with the right timing, and fit in with the rest of the group’s processes and interactions. 

Is this a moment of transition? Is this an enhancement of existing practice? Is this one of many concurrent processes, or a singular focus? Are we here to solve a problem, or go deeper, wider, narrower? These are contextual questions that can define the approach.

Existing Loomio:

* We already emphasise the role of the ‘champion’, who understands the group’s context and makes the call about whether introducing Loomio is right for them.

* Many groups have successfully integrated Loomio into their existing habits and practices - we can learn from them. Any time Loomio fits nicely into existing workflows, groups will adopt it better.

Areas for Research:

* When is the right time in a group’s lifecycle to introduce Loomio, and how can groups self-identify this?

* What are the signals that a group is ready to incorporate online collaborative practice effectively?

* How can we help users have awareness of their group’s attention economy - when the right time to raise a given topic might be?

* Many groups are not even cognisant of their existing collaborative practice and habits, much less clear about how Loomio might fit in… how do we assist with this self-awareness?

* How can we help users of Loomio build skills for getting the timing right for collaboration interventions (eg, starting a group or discussion)? Facilitators have "spidey senses" for this - can the software be a spidey-helper?

## The Role of the Facilitator

Good facilitation requires quite a bit of self-awareness - on an individual and collective level. Lack of understanding of the nature of the role can lead to misunderstanding, tension, conflict, or unsafe situations.

*Have the power handed over to you. When you’re invited into a new group or organisation, everybody will be thinking: Who’s this joker? Why should we listen to them? Get somebody who the participants know and trust to introduce you. This builds you up in the participants’ minds and helps to hand over the power over to you. -- Silvia Zuur*

**Consent:** It’s critical that the group consents to be facilitated. Attempting to facilitate otherwise can be at worst coercive (unfair to the group), and dangerous (unfair to the facilitator), and will be dragged down by resistance and confusion. Facilitators put themselves in a vulnerable position - they must have mandate or they should not agree to engage. 

**Responsibility:** Once a facilitator takes up a mandate, they carry enhanced responsibilities, which need to be understood on all sides. Facilitation introduces power differentials - there must be trust and consent. For example, facilitators have more claim to floor time, and directing the group’s attention. This has to be used in service to the whole, not a personal agenda. The words and demeanor of the facilitator will also have a disproportionate effect, meaning they have to act with heightened consideration.

**Power: **If the facilitator cannot exercise power in certain ways, they cannot do their job. If the group has given a mandate, for example, for the facilitator to keep a discussion on topic, the facilitator has to be allowed to take acts others might not in the discussion, such as interrupting someone, or saying that a certain way of interacting is not OK. It’s not appropriate to expect a facilitator to shoulder responsibility for the experience without giving them the powers they need to deliver. There is no one right answer about how much power - just that it has to be balanced with the level of responsibility.

**Responsiveness:** Facilitators do their best work when they can adapt effectively to the emergent reality. Human beings are endlessly complex, and groups of them exponentially more so. Rigid adherence to a plan or protocol without flexibility will usually set the group up to fail, or at least not succeed as well as it could have. If a facilitator is not allowed or not willing to adapt to changing circumstance, they cannot effectively hold the space.

*Wear and un-wear the facilitation-hat. A challenge many people face is trying to facilitate meetings and workshops with their own team. As a facilitator, they need to be neutral. But as a team member, they have valuable insights to share. Make it really clear when you’re a facilitator and when you’re being a participant. -- Silvia Zuur*

Existing Loomio:

* Many groups using Loomio are experienced with facilitation and already have a shared understanding of the role. They already adapt the tool to meet these needs with some success.

* Often the person who starts a discussion is assumed to be facilitating it, barring another agreed understanding in the group.

* Loomio naturally creates a dynamic open to distributed acts of facilitation, such as users tagging in others, requests to stay on topic, suggestions of the right timing for a proposal, etc (but this often left implicit).

Areas for Research:

* How can we help groups who are less experienced with facilitation see, understand, and value it? The ideal would be that even groups without experienced facilitators in them could have an experience that feels facilitated, because of the software design.

* How can we help groups to become aware of when they need facilitation, and how to get it?

* How can we better understand what aspects of facilitation could be done by software, what must be done by humans, and what can be enhanced by people using software?

* How can we understand the role of the facilitator when it’s spread across many people, which is more the norm online?

* Sometimes what’s called for is a specific, human, named facilitator. How can we enable this is in a better way? For example we have had numerous requests for a feature to name a facilitator for a conversation or group, and have that indicated by the software. We could also enable distributing this function (eg, marking your own comment as an act of facilitation as opposed to an individual contribution).

# Commencing

## Invitation

How participants are invited into a facilitated space is incredibly important. People understand huge amounts of information from the invitation, and use it to judge how carefully a space will be held, and if they feel they belong there. The moment of invitation is in many ways the defining opportunity to set the tone and establish trust.

*Decision-making is all about communication: your group can only make good decisions together if there’s a foundation of good communications in place first. This means being clear about what the purpose of a discussion or meeting is, who needs to be involved, what the time-frame is, and what people can expect. -- Richard Bartlett*

Key aspects to an invitation:

* Background information. What is this thing? What am I being asked to do? Who is behind this? Who else will be involved? What is the time commitment, topic focus, and protocol?

* Context. What is the character of this specific engagement? Of all the possible formats and ways it could go, which one will it be? Why now, why this way?

* Am I welcome? Is this for me? Am I needed in this process? What is my unique value and contribution? Why should I specifically be compelled?

* Is it safe? Does this invitation indicate thoughtfulness, trust, and understanding? Is the structure of the engagement up to handling the inherent power dynamics at play? What level of honesty or vulnerability will this require of me? Do I think the person facilitating/inviting is going to hold me well?

* Is this accessible? Will my basic requirements for participation be accommodated? Language, assistive technology, unfamiliar jargon, etc. Will it be possible for me to engage?

Existing Loomio:

* The practicalities behind inviting users to participate on Loomio has been one of our biggest UX and functionality focuses - and remains one of our biggest challenges. 

* We have worked to dramatically lower barriers to accepting the invitation to participate on a practical level - improving the "invite user" process, etc.

* Currently champions often have to introduce people to the idea of Loomio through a separate process, so they are expecting the invitation to join a group.

* Many aspects of Loomio are already designed to create a safe and respectful space users would want to enter - such as thoughtful privacy options.

Areas for Research:

* How can we increase the personalisation and relevance of the invitation experience? How can we bring to the fore the identity of the inviter (presumably known the user), the nature of the invitation (what they are being asked to do) and why they should accept (relevance to what they care about)?

* What can we do to make the job of champion easier, helping them to create better invitations to their group users? How can more of the total invitation job be achieved with the process you go through in Loomio, as opposed to having to prepare users to receive the software invitation separately?

* Could we do more to reassure people about what they are stepping into - such as revealing privacy settings more clearly, and accessibility features?

* How can we give inviters more tools and guidance so they can craft good invitations? 

## Arrival

The moment of arrival is the "first impression" of an engagement, and sets the trajectory from there on out. At the moment of arrival, the person has accepted an invitation and decided to step in. They are open and expectant, and the impression they get will make a big impact on their experience. 

**Welcoming: **To enable openness to engagement, participation, and receptivity, a person has to feel welcome. They need their existence acknowledged, and to feel a sense of hospitality.

**Settling:** When someone enters a room, they want to know where to sit, where the exit is, where to go to the bathroom, if there is coffee available. They need a basic introduction to the space and their place in it.

Existing Loomio:

* We kind of drop people in without much guidance right now, but are working on a better first experience.

* The group description fields and discussion context box are the main space to put a "welcome message" for people arriving into the space. The simple fact that we call it a “context box” indicates the awareness of this in the design.

* We have put a decent amount of work into improving the ability to find what you’re looking for in Loomio, if you know what you’re looking for (the dashboard and unread views, notifications, starred threads, etc).

* The design of Loomio has a gentle "current" that pushes people to take steps like starting discussions, commenting, starting proposals, stating positions, setting outcomes, etc - but much of it is unspoken.

* It’s possible to give yourself a tour of the Loomio space, and tweak things to make yourself comfortable (like notification settings, etc).

Areas for research:

* We could be much more opinionated in our guidance of what actions we want people to take. People feel less anxious when they are held and given strong guidance. It’s the difference between a facilitated process and dropping people into a room for unstructured conversation.

* How can we give people a tour, show them around, and make them feel like they know where they are, and what they are here to do?

* Could the ‘welcoming’ experience into Loomio be more personalised? Can we greet people by name, and connect them to information customised to who they are and what their group is about? For example, leveraging group content for invitation messages, etc.

* How can we better reveal ways users can make the space their own, and the options they have to customise the space to make themselves comfortable? It seems many users are not fully aware of their options around things like email settings, starring threads, the different content views, etc. 

## Who’s in the Room

Introducing yourself and being introduced to others is one of the most basic and most important human social functions. From Māori mihimihi to British "how do you do"s to Japanese business card exchanges, every culture places a lot of importance on this. It goes beyond practicalities and politeness and touches on some sort of deep human need, which is a prerequisite for comfort, openness, and focus.

As a facilitator, if you don’t give people a chance to introduce themselves and find out who is around them, and you expect them to talk to one another as a group, they will generally subvert whatever else you’re trying to point their attention at until you allow this process to occur. It’s generally much better to consciously design in introductions as a feature, and use them as an opportunity to further the overall goals of the interaction.

Even among groups who already know each other well, this introduction process continues - this is the basis for "checking in" and other good practices for team cohesion. People wear a constantly shifting multitude of layered identities, which change based on the context of the situation, the phase of an interaction, and who else is involved. People answer and re-answer “who am I for this moment” all the time, and that is what allows people to orient around one another.

*We start many of our meetings with everyone ‘checking in’ before we get to the agenda. These check-ins are focused not on your work tasks, but on how you’re doing as a human being. If you’re going through a rough patch at home, or you’re sick, or you have exciting positive news, understanding your state of mind will help the entire group have the right context to interpret how you’re communicating. -- Richard Bartlet**t*

Existing Loomio:

* Introduction threads are one of the oldest and longest-standing Loomio "hacks", where people adapt the existing tool to do what they need it to do, even if that’s not how the software has been designed.

* For ‘request to join’ groups, we have a function that allowed the requestor to introduce themselves to the coordinator to get access to the group (but this text is not used in any other way or published to other group members).

* People tend to use their real name on Loomio (usually), and often put up a profile photo - these help people understand a little bit about who someone is.

Areas for research:

* Can we expand the user profile page to make it a more useful tool for people to express themselves and find out more about each other? How can we allow people to vary how they present themselves to different groups, without making users re-write their profile information repeatedly?

* Could introductions be a built-in part of the experience of joining a Loomio group? 

* How can we better support coordinators who are spending lots of time hacking a manual "introductions" process on Loomio already? (Loomio Community and Enspiral are both examples of this).

* How can we improve the experience of a new person joining an existing group and trying to orient themselves around who all these people are? Current introduction threads quickly get hugely long, and it’s not possible to click from someone’s name in another thread to their comment in an introduction thread, even if that content does exist.

* How can we support coordinators who might not be as experienced in facilitation to understand the role and importance of people in a group getting to know a bit about one another? 

* How can our processes acknowledge that a multi-faceted view of someone’s personal context is an essential aspect of interpreting their comments, proposals, and positions in decision-making?

* Can we do more to encourage people to upload profile pictures? Photos of faces are one of the most powerful ways of feeling like you know who is in the room with you online, and it seems that many people who would not be averse to putting up a photo just don’t think of it or realise its importance.

## Who’s NOT in the Room

Diversity is critical for quality group decision-making. The "wisdom of the crowd effect" often spoken of in regard to collective intelligence, only works by combining a variety of viewpoints. Outcomes of collaboration processes depend heavily on which voices are, and are not, represented. It’s impossible to have perfect representative inclusion, but you need to at least be aware of who might be missing and take it into account. That’s why it’s so important to ask who’s not in the room. 

It’s extremely common for people to have blind spots around privilege. Humans are not great at intuiting bias, and a lot better at noticing the presence of something than the absence. Our minds trick us. For example studies show that when women and men are deliberately given an equal amount of talking time, there is often a perception that women are getting more than their fair share. It can be necessary to actually measure or count, instead of relying on intuition. 

Someone who does not have certain mobility or accessibility needs may not even notice that a venue isn’t wheelchair accessible, a document isn’t formatted for screen readers, or a situation is excluding someone with hearing loss. This works across many aspects of life, such as someone who doesn’t have kids not thinking that a 7PM meeting time might not work for those who do, or a thousand other practical, social, and cultural elements that could block someone from being in the room.

It’s especially important to think about who is not in room when trying to solve problems for others - build with, not for; talk with people, not about them. If the people you are trying to serve are not in the room, it’s very unlikely you’ll have all the inputs you need to be effective. This is just as much about effectiveness for business outcomes as about social justice - it’s almost always better to design in collaboration with the users or stakeholders.

Existing Loomio:

* Collaborating online allows for whole other levels of inclusion, when handled consciously. Instead of thinking about a "digital divide", you can think about the “digital bridge” - technology can allow people who cannot attend in-person meetings to have a voice, lower barriers to participation, and enable whole new possibilities like multi-lingual discussions.

* Loomio makes it very clear who is in a group, and who has participated in a discussion, which gives important information for thinking about inclusion. If people are missing, you can tell.

Areas for Research:

* Could Loomio collect demographic information to help groups more objectively measure inclusion?

* How can we encourage people to ask "who’s not in the room", and understand the relationship between inclusion/accessibility and high quality decision outcomes? We should be making the case that inclusion is the right thing for decision-making not just because it’s right, but because it’s essential to achieve the outcomes people want, ie making the right decisions.

* How can Loomio become even more accessible to even more kinds of people?

## Culture, Protocol, Expectations

Culture can be quite a nebulous concept, and operates at multiple levels. The culture of the wider society has a big influence, but in a way you can think of every group, and every session or discussion, as having a culture of its own. 

Culture influences protocols and expectations. How do we roll? How do we talk to one another? What is and is not ok here? What are the rules of the game of how we interact? The process of confronting these questions can be a powerful moment of self-awareness for a group, and not confronting them can harm its ability to meet its goals, or sometimes tear apart the group completely.

Culture, protocol, and expectations can be implicit or explicit, and by nature intersect in complex ways with power dynamics and social capital. It’s a challenging balance to keep things loose enough to allow emergence, evolution, creativity, and freedom, while being explicit enough about bottom lines and boundaries to ensure safety.

Facilitators often play the role of guiding the group to live the culture it has set for itself, follow the protocols it has agreed, and hold it to account for the expectations that have been set. If a facilitator is tasked with this role, they need to be backed by a certain level of explicitness about those agreements, and a certain mandate - otherwise it can get messy.

People often want to leave things to "common sense" or “basic decency”, and avoid agreeing a code of conduct or explicit protocols. However, this can disproportionately affect the most vulnerable members of the group, since they will feel the negative impacts of bad behavior or culture first and strongest, and are least empowered to counteract it themselves. 

Like a legal contract, you hope you never have to enforce your code of conduct, but if you need it you’re very glad it’s there, and that you agreed it before it became necessary. In short, in order for a facilitator or any member of the group to effectively stand up and say, "that’s not OK here", you need to have invested in culture building and expectation setting.

Existing Loomio:

* Because Loomio is marketed and used as a space for constructive deliberation, and groups with a specific purpose and set of members are the most common type of users, people for the most part engage in good faith and behave respectfully.

* Loomio is designed specifically to give voice to the individual, and let them communicate their needs and concerns. So even if a majority doesn’t see a problem, a single person can raise it in and at least be noticed.

* Some groups already use the group description field to note a code of conduct or expectations for behavior. Others have collectively agreed a set of expectations that govern participation.

* Communicating online enables a certain level of physical safety, because people are not face to face. 

* Many groups use Loomio itself to decide their group protocols, such as how to engage, what is allowed, what a decision means and what makes it valid, etc.

* Some core protocol issues are answered simply by using Loomio in the most basic way - who is allowed here, how do we communicate.

Areas for Research:

* Could we support people to be more explicit with their group protocols, and think through things like the culture they want to create, and how they might enforce boundaries and bottom lines?

* Some groups would be served by a Code of Conduct that users have to agree to in order to join. This is especially true for larger groups where people might not know each other personally.

* Anonymity can work both for and against safety, civility, and equality - how do we handle the issue of anonymity in service of helping groups create constructive cultures?

* What do we know about best practice around balancing implicit vs explicit protocols and expectations? When is it good to keep things loser, and when is it good to nail them down? Different kinds of collaborations will require a different approach - there are patterns we could identify and share.

* One of the most basic protocol related decisions Loomio users all encounter is their decision-making protocol - Consensus? Majority? Quorum? Unanimity? We know a lot about the different options people can use, but we don’t share this knowledge or guide people through settling these questions. Loomio enables a departure from traditional methodologies like majority rules or Robert’s Rules of Order, but we do not offer much guidance for understanding the alternatives. 

# Underway

## Where are we on the Map?

People feel more confident and better held if they can orient themselves within a process or timeline. Facilitators often open a session with an overview of the agenda, and contextualisation of a particular moment within the timeline of a larger process (if relevant). It’s also common to write the agenda/timeline up where everyone can see, to help participants continually understand where they are at a given point in the process. 

People want to know what they’re doing now, what’s coming up, and be reminded of what they’ve already done. Understanding the overall shape of the process helps people understand how to contribute effectively - for example if they can see there’s a Q&A section later, they’ll accept an ‘information upload’ section without interrupting. If it’s clear that there’s a divergent phase and then a convergent phase, people will be more willing to hold back from jumping to solutions too soon. People need to know what kind of input they are being asked for when, and if they can see how the pieces fit together they will participate more effectively. 

Mapping the process well enough to communicate it also challenges facilitators and process designers to fully think through the journey they are inviting people on, and helps them make sure each part of the process has a purpose that builds a cohesive whole. A well facilitated experience follows a logical progression.

Existing Loomio:

* A Loomio decision already follows a basic logical progression, which is why it works: Gather (open/invite), Discuss (divergent), Propose (convergent), Decide and Act (conclude). 

* Many Loomio users are employing the tool as part of explicitly mapped experiences, such as a multi-stage consultation process. Experienced facilitators are able to work it into their existing practice with some success.

* We offer some tools of facilitators to help "reveal the map" to users, such as the group description field, and proposal deadlines. 

Areas for Research:

* Could we give better tools to facilitators to "reveal the map" to their group members? If someone is using Loomio as part of structured process, could we help them better communicate/reveal that?

* Could we do more to make explicit the built-in process phases in Loomio, such as the "divergent" discussion phase and “convergent” proposal phase?

* How can we help groups who don’t have experienced facilitators to understand mapping a collaboration journey, and marking where they are on it as they go?

* There are probably ‘recipies’ being employed by Loomio users already - could we tell these stories better  and make these "maps" available for other groups to use?

## The Art of Noticing

Noticing is probably the most critical facilitation skill of all. The facilitator uses the art of noticing to figure out what interventions or responses are needed, how to invite the right contributions, and to help the group notice what’s going on with individuals and the whole. The value of facilitation really stems from having someone specifically paying attention and acting on what they notice, while others may be focused on specific content, their own agendas, etc. 

The informational inputs, and the ability to interpret and act on them, make all the difference. Many facilitators talk about "reading" a room. What are they “reading”? It’s everything from emotional reactions, to tensions, to power dynamics. To do this effectively, they need information and signalling systems.

Existing Loomio:

* Many current features assist with noticing - the biggest one is probably statements of positions on proposals and how the pie is shaping up. But also other information like who has and has not yet participated, what topics are being raised, who has and has not accepted their group invitation, etc are also helpful.

* In some ways Loomio makes it much easier to practice noticing and make interventions in response - a single facilitator can read across dozens of discussions at the same time, see clearly what’s being shared, and act accordingly. Talking online can make much of what is implicit in person explicit, and therefore easier to notice.

* Communicating in writing can be very good for naming what’s being noticed and why a certain action is being taken in response. For example, you can quote someone’s exact words and reflect back what’s revealed by them. Or you can do the same thing at the level of a whole discussion, picking out a range of quotes and noticing themes or emerging conflicts, etc.

* Noticing is much easier when you slow things down, which is one of Loomio’s great advantages - asynchronous communication you can read at any pace. It also makes it possible to notice across time, referring directly to past discussions.

Areas for Research:

* As an online tool, there are many inputs to noticing that are harder - for example, nonverbal communication like facial expression or tone of voice. What could we do to help users communicate in a more multidimensional way, such as sharing feelings? This would become important input for noticing.

* While online communication creates some disadvantages, it also creates some key benefits for noticing. It’s possible to quantify things online we can never measure offline. There is a lot of important information that have, but is hidden on Loomio currently. For example, how many people have read a discussion but not participated, if someone is posting a disproportionate amount, etc, along with heaps of other potential metrics. This information could be very powerful for a facilitator, or to help the group self-facilitate.

* We don’t currently collect user demographics, which are important aspects to noticing group dynamics. For example, noticing that women aren’t speaking up, or that older people are consistently voting against the majority.

* Could Loomio ‘dispassionately’ notice some things, and help improve discussions without needing users to spend their personal capital (which naming a noticing often does)? For example, revealing group metrics, signalling when there seems to be conflict, naming that some people are participating too much or not enough? What can the software notice and share so people don’t have to?

* An emerging and exciting area of technology is "augmented intelligence" - as opposed to artificial intelligence which seeks to replace human activity with computers, augmented intelligence is about computers doing what computers are good at in a way that assists humans to be even better at what humans are good at. Could Loomio create “augmented facilitation”, providing information and triggers to humans who can use them to do great facilitation?

## Hearing Diverse Voices

In our society, multiple layers of history, power dynamics, culture, and psychology conspire to amplify certain voices and suppress others. This plays out at every level of experience, from our innermost subconscious beliefs to our political system and laws, and everything in between. But the best ideas and important information does not always come from the loudest voices: the role of facilitation is to counteract these biases. It’s a big concept to take on all of society’s baggage, but it’s important to be aware of the dynamics we are collectively grappling with if our goal is social justice, group effectiveness, and high quality decision-making.

*If you want to innovate, you have to make space for different points of view — luckily, this is also what you need to do if you want a team where everyone is empowered. All kinds of cultural and technical factors conspire to privilege some voices at the expense of others. There are many practices you can implement to systematically challenge that bias, but just being aware of it is a good starting point. -- Richard Bartlett*

Perhaps due to the universal lived human experience of inhabiting a singular consciousness, humans tend to forget that others don’t actually think or experience the world like they do. Even within a seemingly very homogenous group of people, there is incredible diversity - perspectives, communication styles, pace, preferences. Internalising this truth is a central personal growth challenge for many facilitators. 

There is no such thing as one size fits all - any mode of interacting enhances some voices and quiets others, or emphasises different tendencies within an individual. So it’s necessary to employ a range of approaches and modes if the goal is to invite the best from multiple diverse voices.

*Check you’re catering to different learning styles. One simple way to check is with the Head, Heart, Hands metaphor. People who learn with their Head need facts and detailed information. A Heart learner thrives off stories. They need an emotional connection to the work. Learning with the Hands is all about doing stuff and getting active. -- Silvia Zuur*

One of the best approaches to bringing out and weaving together diverse voices is to invite diverse modes of interaction, which will serve different needs and preferences, and level the communication playing field. 

Some classic design building blocks to address communication diversity in collaborative communication: 

* **Group size** - individual reflection, pairs, small group, large group, one-to-one, one-to-many, many-to-many

*It’s important to use a mixture of individual, paired, small group and whole activities. If you continually go to the whole group, the quieter people just won’t feel comfortable participating. Think carefully about the purpose of each part of a session and the most appropriate group size. -- Silvia Zuur*

* **Medium of expression** - writing, drawing, video, singing, dance, flowcharts, equations, symbols, stories, tears, laughter, debate, etc.

* **Discussion protocols** - rounds (hear from each person once before moving on), rate limiting (you can only speak again after two others have spoken), talking stick (only speak when you have the stick - no interrupting), time-limited contributions (you can talk for 1 minute only), time-unlimited contributions (you can hold the floor indefinitely and everyone will deeply listen), tracking contributions (how much have women vs men spoken, etc), holding periods of silence between speakers.

*Embrace silence. Silence is only awkward if you let it be awkward. Silence is a chance for people to think. -- Silvia Zuur*

Existing Loomio:

* The design of Loomio has always been about ‘hearing all voices’, including people who aren’t able to be there in person, are quieter, are busy, etc. This is a big part of our core value proposition, and the simple facts of asynchronous written communication go a long way toward it. In text, every voice is more or less the same "volume".

* The proposal feature is essentially a "round", assisting groups to facilitate each individual person having their say (if they want to), on an equal basis with all the other participants.

* Loomio enables multi-media to some extent, including links to videos, images, diagrams, supporting evidence etc, which serves various communication styles.

* With active facilitation and group maturity, it could be possible to employ discussion protocols "manually" (eg, just agree to not post another comment until others have contributed, etc)... but in practice there is a high barrier to implementing such practices.

* Users have created different group sizes using parent groups and subgroups, and some large consultation processes have involved multiple smaller groups which are then synthesised into a larger outcome.

* It’s common for people who work best using individual reflection to take time out and process their thoughts, and then come back and share a longer comment or link to a document. This is a "self-selecting" example of creating interplay between individual and group communication.

* Loomio accessibility features and multi-lingual translations make it possible for people with very different needs to participate as equals in one discussion. This is a key example of how technology can enable equitable participation in a way that’s nearly impossible in person.

* If someone is contributing more than their share (talking too much), it’s technically possible to just scroll on by (whereas in person this behaviour can totally dominate the interaction and requires much more proactive interventions to counteract). However, in practice, people posting ‘walls of text’ can still be detrimental to a balanced Loomio discussion.

Areas for research:

* Could Loomio enable and support different discussion protocols, such as rounds where you can only contribute once until everyone else has commented, or limiting the total characters each person is allowed in a discussion? Or, if not hard limits/protocols, then perhaps revealing more data about who is and is not being heard so people can become more aware and adjust their behaviour? 

* How can Loomio better support different media? Could we do a better job incorporating video, pictures, and other modes of expression?

* How could Loomio facilitate calls for individual reflection, or pair discussions that then feed back into the group discussion? Currently, two people getting into a back and forth exchange tends to dominate a discussion and put others off jumping in, but often those back and forth discussions dig deeper into an issue - could these comments be threaded or otherwise encouraged to continue in a way that doesn’t dominate the space?

* In Loomio, walls of text are the equivalent of someone talking too much. How can we make space for those who need to go into lots of detail to communicate, are sharing something requiring a lot of detail, or work best by ‘thinking out loud’, without allowing them to dominate the space disproportionately, or alienate slow readers or people who feel they must read every word before participating themselves? 

* Could we design for "neuro"-personas? Such as introverts, extraverts, internal processors, external processors, emotional communicators, analytical communicators, those who thrive on conflict and debate, those who need harmonious interaction, etc.

* How can we better reveal and make visible Loomio’s already powerful accessibility and language features? For example, two people who don’t speak the same language can participate in collaborative decisions using the in-line translation feature, alongside a blind person using a screen reader - this is mind blowing, but little known to most people using or considering using Loomio.

* Could we better enable groups to communicate with other groups, or collaborative practice between subgroups and parent groups? Often, the best move is to break out smaller groups and then weave their work back into the whole - how do we support this process in Loomio?

## Counter Cognitive Bias

Human brains have evolved over millions of years to try and balance quick, efficient ‘good enough’ thinking with slow, expensive, deep analysis. Most of the time, this works pretty well, and allows us to get it right using instincts, heuristics, and generalisations. But other times, we get it wrong. In fact, there are well-known "bugs" in the human thought program, which can trip people up and keep them from making the best decisions. This is further complicated in group situations. To make good decisions, we need to have awareness of these dynamics.

There is a huge [range of cognitive biases](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_cognitive_biases) (this list is really worth a read), all of which have potential impacts on decision-making and collaboration. Facilitation can be an important tool to deal with them, to raise awareness of their existence, encourage proactive choices about them (eg, when is it more important to move quickly and when is it more important to be accurate), and employ tools to reveal or counteract them.

One powerful tool to counter cognitive bias and increase quality of decisions is structured processes and communication. Processes can be designed to counter cognitive errors specifically, but just the simple challenge of following a process instead of the "path of least resistance" for one’s brain can help highlight thinking errors and bias. This can put the facilitator in the position of pushing the group to do things that feel challenging or trigger resistance, precisely because their brains are being asked to step out of familiar patterns. But some discipline in this area can help groups achieve their deeper goals, which many participants will agree is worth some temporary discomfort.

Some examples of processes that can help mitigate cognitive bias:**
**

* [De Bono’s Hats](http://www.debonoforschools.com/asp/six_hats.asp): different colored hats participants can wear (metaphorically) to step outside their own opinions and try on different modes of thinking and input.

* Checklists: thinking ‘ruts’ can cause us to miss even obvious things, so a checklist of aspects to consider or process points can be helpful to weed out errors.

* The Five Why’s: only asking why once or twice can mislead you that you’ve reached the conclusion before you get to the root level of the issue.

* Mental models: exercises like SWOT analysis, business canvases or other structured information gathering exercises can guide you to think of all aspects of an issue.

Existing Loomio:

* Getting more diverse information and inputs to possibly disrupt assumptions or bias is built into Loomio’s basic design, by enabling more voices to contribute to a discussion on a more equitable basis.

* Loomio has powerful tools that help counter groupthink, namely the ability to dissent constructively. Safe and valued dissent is essential for a culture of critical thinking.

* Communicating asynchronously in writing slows conversation down and lets it be more carefully considered - this is a key advantage Loomio has over other modes of communication.

* Loomio already invites people into a semi-structured process that leads them to more considered decision-making than totally unstructured communication. People feel the difference and it’s a key aspect to the value they get from the tool (even if they are not aware where this effect is coming from in the design).

Areas for Research:

* Could Loomio make invitations for alternative thinking, to raise the quality of decisions? For example, prompting users to consider the opportunity costs of proposals, suggesting coming up with several alternative ideas before heading too far down the track with the first one, warnings against ‘anchoring’ in initial discussion context info, etc.

* Could Loomio make it easier for facilitators to deploy specific thinking tools, such as De Bono’s Hats? Plug-ins informed by facilitation expertise could offer powerful gains in decision quality. Ideally it would be made easier to run these processes even without an experienced facilitator.

* Revealing certain information can help make certain biases more clear. For example, it can seem like "everyone" thinks a certain way (leading you to drop you valuable point of dissent) when in fact the group has only heard from a few people thus far.

* Loomio will likely never be a highly engineered tool for countering cognitive bias (because it will stay simple and flexible), but could integrate with other tools which are (like Cloverpop for example).

## Balancing Divergent / Convergent 

The ‘diamond’ of divergence and convergence is a conversational shape that expands outward at first - opening up space for ideas, information, and different perspectives - then begins to come to a point, narrowing down to a specific conclusion. The right timing for this shift, and making sure the shift occurs, is key for effective facilitation of action-oriented discussion. The rhythm of this process is the nature of productive collaboration (where people work together to synthesise new solutions).

If divergence is missed out or cut off too early, there will be a lack of information to work with, people may not feel heard, and great ideas will be left unsaid. If convergence is missed out or left too late, discussion can continue indefinitely without reaching an actionable conclusion, burning participants energy and failing to achieve results.

The phases of each can be further broken down: divergence consists of introduction, clarification, ideation, etc, and convergence consists of analysis, conclusion, commitment, etc. Each sub-phase of the larger process also requires awareness of the right timing and intervention. Some discussions succeed with only a vague nod toward the diamond, while others are served by a meticulous breakdown of each phase and sub-phase. 

Within a group, different individuals will usually tend to prefer one mode or the other, and the group as a whole will have collective tendencies toward too much blue sky thinking, jumping to solutions, or other ways the diamond can be unbalanced. Facilitation can help each person and the group as a whole spend the right amount of energy on the different modes. 

Existing Loomio:

* The core Loomio process does an excellent job of guiding groups to touch on each phase of the process, with the discussion being divergent and proposals being convergent. Awareness of the diamond was a big inspiration for the original design of the Loomio process.

* Loomio helps groups to use the diamond in dynamic ways, such as when an attempt to converge (a proposal) ends up becoming a deeper level of divergence (disagreement), revealing or clarifying information to support an even better convergence (iterated proposal).

* Some of Loomio’s basic features go a long way toward supporting each mode, such as notifications to group members when a new discussion is starting (prompting divergent contribution), and deadlines on proposals.

* Loomio users are already able to use the existing feature set to facilitate convergence - namely starting a proposal. Good use of proposals is one of the most obvious symptoms of an effective Loomio group, and simply advising users to start more proposals unblocks many groups who are having issues.

Areas for research:

* The trickiest part of working with divergence and convergence is about timing the shift from one mode to the other. Could Loomio better assist users? For example, prompting them to start a proposal once a discussion has been in the divergent phase for a long time? Warning them not to start a proposal too early? Reflecting stats like: when your group reached X% of participants commenting (or let the discussion go for X days) before going to a proposal, you were X% more likely to reach a clear outcome.

* If a move toward convergence does not gain consensus, how can Loomio better support users to understand that this is not a failure, but a very valuable moment in the process that can lead to a new level of mutual understanding and innovation? Users may need support to keep going after a ‘failed’ proposal and not get discouraged just at the moment of opportunity.

* Could Loomio more explicitly reveal the existence of the diamond, so groups could work with it more effectively? For example, naming the divergent and convergent phases as they are happening, so users know how to best engage (the equivalent of having time to brainstorm without shooting other’s ideas down, and then not getting distracted by extraneous information when it’s time to focus on a specific point).

## Working with Scope

Successful collaboration often depends on biting off the right size piece, and biting them off in a effective order. You can apply a ‘project management’ mindset to facilitation, designing for questions like: What are the dependencies (what’s the critical path, which things need to be done first to enable other things)? What’s the most important bits to focus on? What is an achievable scope to tackle at a given time to get to a useful place with the time, energy, and information available?

It’s important not to try to "boil the ocean", and instead break things down into manageable chunks. You can build toward a bigger outcome in a series of smaller pieces. It’s often better to achieve something small but useful - building trust, confidence, and energy - than to fail to reach any conclusions by aiming too large. It’s also possible to get too bogged down in details and fail to hit the bigger issues, so hitting the right scope is a balance.

One useful technique is "a series of small yeses". Lumping too many conversations together simply creates confusion. Frustrated groups are often helped by breaking things down and taking them on in pieces. If an issue seems hopeless complex or conflicted, it can be possible to separate out individual questions and reach consensus on them, starting with the aspect that already have agreement. Then when it comes to points of disagreement, you can pare it down to only the crux of the issues and work on them in a focused way.

Managing scope is a dynamic process. The point of collaboration and discussion is that no one knows going on exactly what will emerge - so scope must evolve with the discussion. Whether a conversation branching out is seen as a distraction or an evolution of thinking is a judgement call. Too much rigidity and too much flexibility can both be damaging. Often times it’s not about whether something is relevant or not relevant, but a question of sequence and timing in terms of what will be most constructive.

*If you plan a session with multiple, interlinked parts – each one building on the other, and all leading to a life-changing, mind-exploding conclusion – and you can pull it off, then that’s amazing. But more often than not, a complicated session will go over-time and may not hit the participant’s wants and needs. -- Silvia Zuur*

Existing Loomio:

* Topic-based discussion threads are a powerful tool for effective scope - even more than face-to-face conversation, Loomio discussions can be usefully delineated to encourage focus on a specific question or part of a problem, while other aspects can be addressed simultaneously in other threads.

* The fact that Loomio is group-based does a lot of the work to define "who are we, and what are we here to discuss (or not)". This helps participants self-select what topics to bring up effectively. 

* In practice, we often see users making facilitation interventions like "That’s out of the scope of this topic, but why don’t you start a new discussion about it?"

* The sequential proposals design of Loomio is very good for a "series of small yesses" approach - you can build small agreements while maintaining focus and context of a single discussion thread, and see the history of previous proposals to build on.

Areas for Research:

* Could we allow Loomio discussions to be branched and merged, to achieve the right scope as information emerges?

* Could we help groups to better define and express their purpose, to help participants scope their communication accordingly?

* Could we better support people to use the discussion context to aim for the right scope? How a discussion is framed can be an important factor in successful scoping. Could users be better supported to help the discussion context evolve with the discussion to keep the scope clear?

* What can we do to better support group facilitators to design the right scope for a given discussion or group? We often see users getting it wrong, either smushing too much into one discussion or group, or trying to break it down into too many tiny pieces. We do know best practice for things like balancing openness and specificity in discussion topics, and when and how to introduce topic subgroups, but we don’t communicate this knowledge well.

## Pacing and Timing

A productive conversation has a rhythm. The right beat comes from the complex combination of the different people, inputs, and circumstances, and often feels intuitive, like a musician. When is the moment to go deeper, or pull back? When is it right to bring in new information, or further delve into what’s already on the table? 

Different participants will have different needs and preferences - some will need reigning in, while others need pulling along. The right pace emerges when a creative tension between digging deeper and moving forward is found. When it’s off in either direction, people will feel frustrated - either impatient or left behind.

Existing Loomio:

* Loomio provides a decent platform for a pace that suits the group to emerge, even without proactive facilitation. Because it’s asynchronous, people can read and respond at their own pace. 

* It’s also possible to scroll right past people moving slowly and push for forward momentum, and simultaneously possible to continue digging into something slowly while others press forward. This is a special ability not possible in synchronous communication.

* Groups have been seen to quite effectively figure out their own speed for setting proposal deadlines. Groups/topics that need to move quickly use shorter timeframes, and longer ones when appropriate to the decision. Users seem to fairly intuitively grasp that different decisions can go at different speeds and act accordingly.

* It’s easy to "hop on and off the train" to modulate your own pace of engagement. For example, if a conversation is moving too fast or slowly for you, you can drop your input and step back, and then return later when a proposal is raised to state your position.

* It’s interesting to note how a "fast" decision on Loomio is 1 or 2 days, while a “fast” decision in person is more like 5 minutes. And yet, Loomio does not seem “slow” (the way taking 2 days to reach a decision in person would). This is probably because of the ability to run Loomio decision in parallel to other ongoing work (multi-channel parallel processing), and because it’s so much more efficient gathering everyone’s input on Loomio over 2 days versus having to schedule an in-person meeting.

* Facilitation on Loomio could be likened to "bullet time" (when Neo can stop time and just walk around a bullet in the Matrix) - you can walk through a living conversation frame by frame. It’s like a superpower, but we don’t really articulate it.

Areas for research:

* Proposals are probably the most effective tool in Loomio for pacing. How can we support users to time them well? What do we know about the timing of proposals that leads to clear outcomes?

* Could the UX better support people working at different paces to collaborate together well? For example, could a small subset of the group go deep or fast on an aspect of the discussion without overwhelming the main flow, and then feed back in what they learned? Discussion threading could help a lot with this - the top level comments would be going at once pace, with the sub-comments at another, without interference.

* Could we do a better job helping people "catch up" if they find themselves behind the pace of a discussion? For example, discussion summaries that help you get up to speed so the group can continue the momentum while being inclusive.

* How can we think about the value of "slowing down" communication? Slowing things down can be incredibly helpful for gaining deep understanding and doing your best thinking, and asynchronous written discussion is a unique opportunity to go for quality over speed while still overall achieving efficiency.

* What do we know about the right timeframe for different kinds of decisions, and could we share that understanding with users? There are many variables, such as complexity of the topic, size of the group, and external deadlines or constraints - can we help users think through when to push forward and when to leave more space?

## Managing the Attention Economy

A facilitator is a curator of attention. In collaboration and knowledge-work problem solving, the information available can be literally infinite. It becomes critical to filter it in order to avoid overwhelm. Managing the attention economy means balancing importance to the goals against time and capacity available.

Facilitation can assist with productively shaping the attention economy in a range of ways. One is to help the group to agree what the purpose and scope of a given discussion or process is, and then guide them to stay focused on it. Limiting distractions and steering the conversation back on track are common interventions. 

Another important way facilitators work with attention is to insist on the group holding it long enough. When things get challenging, unclear, or uncomfortable, it’s common for people to want to give up too soon, deflect to another topic, or look away. A facilitator can play a critical role in helping the group see things through or fully process them in service of their goals.

Structured processes and information sorting exercises are important facilitation tools in this area. Some examples:

* Time-boxing a period of brainstorming, to let out all kinds of ideas and information, and then focusing down on a few.

* Listing everything people might want to talk about in the agenda, and then running a process to prioritise the top items to focus on first.

* Generating a bunch of concepts on post-its and grouping them into thematic clouds, which are then condensed into topics.

* Having a "parking lot" space to stick ideas or questions that come up that are not immediately relevant, to be addressed later.

* Defining success criteria for process, and keeping the group focused on it until those criteria are achieved.

Existing Loomio:

* One of the most important attention management features in Loomio is topic-based discussion threading. There’s a reason why this format was one of the first to emerge in online communication decades ago, and continues to be used widely today - it’s a highly effective way to sort attention. Most Loomio users intuitively understand how to stay on topic when it’s listed in big letters at the top of the page.

* Activity in Loomio is like the currency of its attention economy - everything that generates a notification spends it. We have honed our understanding about what should be considered "salient" activity over the years (for example, comments, votes, and outcomes are, while a ‘like’ on a comment is not). We have settled on specific default settings for notifications through trial and error and a lot of user feedback.

* Users can exercise a lot of customised control over their Loomio attention economy through notification settings (although it seems only power users make full use of them).

* Subgroups can be a powerful tool to help people moderate their attention economy - although currently it seems subgroups are mostly employed for different levels of privacy, and their role in attention moderation could be better thought through.

* The intentional but somewhat unpopular design decision to disallow concurrent proposals in Loomio is about the flow of attention - holding a group’s ‘feet to the fire’ so to speak to fully process a proposal before moving on is a powerful way to shake out issues and clarify the landscape of the group’s views. But people often resist this.

*Many designers of information systems incorrectly represented their design problem as information scarcity rather than attention scarcity, and as a result they built systems that excelled at providing more and more information to people, when what was really needed were systems that excelled at filtering out unimportant or irrelevant information. -- **[Wikipedi*a](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attention_economy)

Areas for research:

* We haven’t nailed the notification system to wisely work with the attention economy. Large groups with overwhelming amounts of information have opposite needs from small groups struggling to encourage engagement. How can these be reconciled?

* Could we provide better tools for facilitators to help groups stay on topic? For example, branching a comment to a new discussion.

* Loomio currently doesn’t do a very good job of revealing to a user how they may be affecting the attention economy. For example, starting a discussion in a large group can email hundreds of people, but most users seem oblivious to this. Something about the design is off in this area.

* We have had many complaints of information overload, both at the level of number of discussions in a group, and in terms of amount of content in a given discussion. How can we assist users to manage information overload better? Loomio exists in a context of general information overload in modern life, especially online - how can it serve to improve that problem, not add to it?

* What tools could help people sort and filter their Loomio information better? Ideas include: tagging, better search functionality, pinning discussions to groups, targeting notifications at those who will find the content the most relevant, suggesting users view certain discussions (such as particularly active ones, or ones on certain topics), and functionality for distilling/summarising large amounts of content simply.

* How do we balance the opinionated idea of the value of fully thinking through one proposal before moving on, with people’s desire to sometimes jump to another solution before everyone’s had a chance to weigh in on the current one? A design for proposal amendments to iterations needs to deal skillfully with the attention economy.

## Facilitation Interventions

There are as many facilitation techniques as there are facilitators in the world, and entire libraries books have been written on the topic. It’s not possible to provide a list of interventions. However, it might be useful to consider two categories of interventions.

* Supportive interventions: inviting contribution, going deeper, drawing out, coaxing, nurturing, protecting, creating space

* Assertive interventions: pulling back, shutting down, drawing lines, interrupting, challenging, steering on course, excluding bad behavior

*Singling people out for a contribution will just make them feel like the stupid kid in class who doesn’t know the answer. Instead, a general invite to people who haven’t spoken yet to contribute tells the regular contributors to stay quiet, and gives quieter people the opportunity to step forward. -- Silvia Zuur*

Almost all interventions in face-to-face facilitation can be reimagined and employed in the online space.

Existing Loomio:

* The main tools Loomio offers currently for making interventions are comments, @mentions, adding/removing users, and deleting comments/discussions. These can be employed for various forms of supportive and assertive interventions. The most commonly used is probably comments - simply talking to the group and inviting or trying to reduce certain behavior. 

* Participation permissions offer relatively blunt but effective tools to moderate users, such as allowing or disallowing posting discussions or proposals, etc.

* Loomio offers some trust-based features that other tools lack, such as the ability for all participants to edit discussion contexts (even if it was posted originally by another user). These ideas are inspired by things like Wikipedia and open source software development.

Areas for Research:

* Loomio lacks many moderation features which are considered standard for many online discussion boards. These include kicking, banning, flagging, up/downvoting, user permissioning (giving certain powers to certain users and not others), mod mail (message the coordinator), etc. Could we incorporate more best practice features from web forums?

* Could we better indicate when an intervention is an act of facilitation, as opposed to an individual user’s opinion?

* A huge amount of knowledge exists about effective online forum moderation. Could we bring more of this to our users, who may not think of themselves as forum mods (as opposed to managers, facilitators, or peers) but could be extremely useful to them? How do we translate nearly 40 years of online forum experience into our context?

* Could we more explicitly match online and offline techniques so people can mentally translate between them? Some of our users will have expertise in offline facilitation, and not realise their techniques translate online, while others may have online forum experience and not realise they translate into collaboration facilitation. How can these two parallel worlds intersect on our tool?

# Concluding

## Outcomes & Next Steps

Confirming the outcome can be a critical aspect of feeling like the goals collaborative discussion have been achieved. A facilitator can pull together what’s been said or decided and reflect it back, to help the group walk away with a shared understanding. 

Participants want to walk away feeling like they have the answers to some key questions: What did we do? What does it mean? What will happen now? What is my piece or responsibility? What will be different because we went through this experience? Sometimes the answers to these questions are very concrete, such as action points, while other times they are more abstract, such as deepening shared understanding.

Existing Loomio:

* Decision outcome statements are a very important tool. We’ve correctly seen that a proposal ending is not quite the end, and there’s a need to sum up the meaning of the outcome conclusively.

* Many Loomio discussions come to a natural end without even using proposals or publishing outcomes. These discussions still provide a lot of value.

Areas for Research:

* Could we be doing more with the Outcomes feature, or doing a better job encouraging people to use it? 

* How do we understand, support, and design for discussions which end without using some of the "concluding" functions like proposals and outcomes? Could we help users get more value out of understanding conclusions from their discussions anyway?

## Reporting & Harvesting

To understand the meaning of an experience, you have to inquire into how it fits into the bigger context. What was this moment, in the bigger rhythm of our progress? What form will our understanding from this experience take - a story? a report? a change? a call to action?

Reporting and harvesting are an important function of facilitation, because the experience happens in the moment, but its impact often comes from putting handles on it, giving it a name, and being able to use it in other contexts and refer to it usefully. Some experiences are meant to happen in an instant and then be let go - but most productive collaboration is helped by a tangible harvest, documentation, or reporting.

Existing Loomio:

* One of Loomio’s least talked about and most valuable features is that it is self-documenting - notes write themselves as an integrated part of the process. This creates a gold-mine of archival content for groups, without any extra effort.

* We have some features to support harvesting and archiving specifically, such as the ‘previous decisions’ list, and the export/print discussion option. 

* Search is an important aspect of Loomio harvesting. It’s probably the first way people attempt to locate past discussions to make use of them.

* Many groups use Loomio to smoothly integrate content from various channels - for example, the workflow of posting a meeting announcement and building and agenda on Loomio, having the meeting in person, posting the notes back on Loomio, and making related decisions in that same thread. This expands the "self-harvesting" ability of Loomio beyond the online space, while usefully integrating it into a single archive.

Areas for Research:

* Could we pay more attention to and improve the previous decisions and search features, to make a group’s Loomio archive more useful and its value more apparent?

* Are our discussion export functions serving the need to create reports well enough? What do groups need to turn a Loomio decision into a piece of content that can be employed in other contexts, like a building block?

* How can we skillfully enable both privacy and transparency, to help groups feel confident communicating their Loomio content? We have various privacy settings, but no features specifically around supporting reporting out more widely than the members of a private group.

* Many organisations aspire to transparency, but don’t put it into practice due to practical concerns - could Loomio make good transparency easier, working alongside its powerful ability to passively capture content? How can people share some content, instead of just all or nothing? How can they use Loomio content to craft a story or report?

* Users could probably get a lot of value from referring back to older discussions that they are not currently getting, because interacting with a Loomio archive is not a smooth experience. Could we help users to re-open old discussions on a topic instead of starting new ones, by letting them know the old discussion exists? Could we help people set reminders to refer back to discussions at a point in the future?

## Turning Discussion into Action

There comes a moment when the outcomes of a facilitated collaboration space have to re-engage with the reality outside that room. Occasionally the need is simply to work with ideas and feelings, without worrying about implementation, but usually a group will not reach its goals without applying its decisions and conceptual conclusions to real-world action. This transition is part of the total facilitated experience.

It’s at this point that a collaborative process intersects with other systems of the group or organisation, and the facilitator has to help figure out how it can be weaved in. These other systems might include:

* Power - who actually makes decisions, what has to happen for ideas to turn into reality in the political/social/organisational structure?

* Management - How does this work fit into other work or priorities? What dependencies might exist that need to be understood? 

* Delegation - Who will take responsibility for next steps and actions? Will they be held accountable?

* Communication - How will what’s happened in this process or discussion be relayed to others? What do they need to know?

If there are any blocks around these issues, it can be damaging to leave this realisation until the moment of conclusion. For example, if the participants don’t actually have the power to make a change they have decided, they will feel defeated. It can be advisable to think ahead toward how conclusions could be made into reality when setting up the process in the first place, and scoping the collaboration to the circumstances.

Existing Loomio:

* Users already employ Loomio features to clarify things like who will take what action out of a decision. This happens in ‘manual’ ways like stating a person’s name or a date in a comment or outcome statement.

* Many users accomplish integrating Loomio content into other organisational systems through other channels like reviewing Loomio decision in offline meetings, or transferring outcomes to Trello cards.

* The design of Loomio helps people to determine what needs to happen to turn a discussion into action, even if there’s no specific feature around a function - for example, making a decision naturally leads people to ask, "OK, but how are we going to take this forward?"

Areas for Research:

* We have created space for the "what" and “why” of outcome statements, but not the “who” or the “when” - could we enable tagging users or putting in dates for follow-up as well, to encourage clear action-oriented next steps when appropriate?

* Could Loomio integrate with other task tracking or project management tools?

* The decision archive could function as a useful reference of commitments or delegations, if improved in design.

* Better search functionality could help groups use their Loomio content as a better record of actions and commitments.

* Could we do more to encourage people to come back to previous decisions, and update them with what happened, to tie the conversation more to the real world outcomes?

* Should we be doing more at the early set-up phase of discussions and groups, to help users be more successful when they get to the point of implementing what they’ve decided?

## It Ain’t Over Til It’s Over

Ending well is important. Sometimes the end is determined by running out of time, and sometimes it’s when certain goals are achieved. There’s a ritual to closing a process, and if it’s missed people will feel unsettled. It’s important to recognise implicit and explicit cues indicating if the individuals, and the group as a whole, can feel completion of a process or phase.

Participants often look to the leader or facilitator for confirmation of when it’s actually over, and it usually pays to be explicit about it. Sometimes the signal is a clear statement that the session is wrapping up, a recap of decisions or next steps, and bidding everyone goodbye. Other times groups have established practices like a check-out or a clap.

Existing Loomio:

* The clearest indication of conclusion we have is probably publishing a decision outcome.

* Some groups make use of Thread Archive subgroups to move old discussions to.

* Deactivating a group is the strongest possible ‘closure’ move in Loomio currently.

Area for Research:

* Could we be doing more to encourage use of decision outcomes? Could we prompt for them when they aren’t used? What makes for a good outcomes statement?

* Some users have requested features around closing or archiving discussions. This indicates a need for better tools to create closure. At the same time, re-opening old discussions can lead to very rich continued collaboration at a later date, so it’s important we don’t push users to close things off too strictly.

* Should deactivating a group trigger some kind of message to users? Currently it happens silently. 

* How can we celebrate or help users complete a process?

# Ongoing Practice

## Continuous Improvement

No matter how amazing a group or facilitator is, they can always improve. And no matter where they are starting, if they incrementally head in a good direction, they will get to a better place. If a group has an effective protocol to have a meta-conversation about how they collaborate, then anything is possible. Without that, it will stagnate.

There are many approaches to continuous improvement, but they all create space for reflection and feedback, and a way to make changes in response. For teams that work together on an ongoing basis, they might employ a methodology like agile, including retrospectives and process improvement. For a one-off session a facilitator might simply follow up with a request for feedback to improve for next time.

Existing Loomio:

* People already use Loomio itself to talk about how they use Loomio. It provides an obvious platform to talk about the talking. 

* The process of joining Loomio causes groups to reflect on many aspects of their collaboration and decision-making process, which creates the opportunity to improve it.

Areas for Research:

* Could we provide a better roadmap of "basic" Loomio use, and then more “advanced” use that we’ve seen succeed, so users evolving their practice wouldn’t need to reinvent the wheel?

* Are there especially powerful trigger points that can be learning moments for group reflection, and could we intervene and support it? For example, the first time a proposal fails. 

* A plugin library could be a marketplace of process improvements that new groups could adopt. How can we apply facilitation expertise to its curation?

* How can we help groups who might not be having meta-conversations about how they want to work together, or a safe space to talk about what could be better? Can we give support to people who feel disempowered, like there’s not a way for their concerns to be heard in their group? 

## Distributed Facilitation / Self-facilitation 

As a group becomes more experienced with collaboration, more individuals in it build capacity for facilitation. Facilitation can cease to be a role held by a specific person, and become more of a function that can be distributed around the group. In a peer-facilitation environment, anyone can take acts of facilitation, and a dance of give and take, leading and following, emerges among the participants. For groups with aspirations toward shared leadership and non-hierarchy, this is a very important thing to encourage. 

People who are less used to taking acts of facilitation can be supported with education, invitations, and suggestions of first steps. Some examples of acts of facilitation almost anyone can be encouraged to try: reflecting back what you’re hearing or summarising, inviting others to contribute, asking questions to enhance collective understanding, noticing who is and is not participating, appreciating other’s contributions explicitly. 

*You don’t need an agenda to be a facilitator. Facilitating is just about making a group situation easy. Next time you’re at a family gathering, party or morning tea: approach it like a facilitator and make sure everybody in the group feels included and able to participate. 
-- Silvia Zuur*

Distributed facilitation can work beautifully - and it can also cause people to step all over each other. At first, it’s almost always awkward as people learn the dance. It’s important to differentiate between distributed facilitation (peers helping the collective succeed in collaboration), facipulation (using acts of facilitation to further your own agenda), and backseat facilitation (taking acts of facilitation when you do not have the mandate - such as when a specific facilitator has been named for a reason). 

It’s important to consciously decide when peer facilitation is a good choice, and when a specific facilitator is called for. In certain situations, such as a high-conflict discussion where a specified neutral party is needed, or there is a lack of trust, distributed facilitation might not work.

*Acts of facilitation are not just for the manager, or the person who called the meeting — they are for everyone. -- Richard Bartlett*

Existing Loomio:

* The online space is uniquely suited to distributed facilitation in many ways. Different people can come along at different points and contribute acts of facilitation, depending on what they notice and their skill set. An online discussion is by default a distributed collaboration among peers.

* Loomio is designed with a group of equals in mind. In many ways, a distributed facilitation approach is the best fit for our tool.

* Current Loomio users do peer facilitation all the time, whether they realise that’s what they are doing or not. Simple things like suggesting someone raise a proposal, tagging people in, summarising the process so far, etc, are all acts of facilitation.

Areas for Research:

* How can we provide guidance or balance about when distributed facilitation is a good approach, and when naming a facilitator might be better?

* Could we reveal that people already are taking acts of facilitation, and help them to understand what they are doing and how they might do more of it? Could we offer more education and encouragement?

## The Art of Being Facilitated

Like the skill of being the follow in a ballroom dance pair, being facilitated is an art unto itself. People with experience facilitating themselves, or who have participated in a lot of well-facilitated processes will receive facilitation differently than those who aren’t familiar or who don’t value it. 

On the positive side, skillful receptivity to facilitation can have a big impact on group success. This ranges from things as simple as showing up on time, to following instructions, to being willing to try a new style of thinking or communicating. Sometimes people have a good experience and they don’t quite know why - pointing out that facilitation is the reason for the smoothness or depth can help them understand what it is they valued about the process.

On the negative side, people who can’t or won’t be facilitated can be detrimental to group collaboration. No matter how skilled a facilitator is, if they encounter a certain level of resistance they won’t be able to do their job. Common problems include dominating the discussion, playing devil’s advocate, disrupting the process, disrespecting the facilitator or participants, or being disengaged.

Existing Loomio:

* With a little practice, most users quickly upskill on being responsive to acts of facilitation on Loomio, such as replying when @mentioned

* The ease of taking acts of facilitation on Loomio helps people become more responsive themselves

Areas for Research:

* We don’t have many tools in place for when a participant is not being receptive to facilitation. A single bad actor could wreak havoc through malicious intent, or even just low self-awareness or EQ.

* Could we offer tools to help people be more aware of facilitation, learn to value it, and get better at responding to it? This is the precursor step to learning to take acts of facilitation themselves.

## Culture Change 

A collaborative, participatory culture is something that emerges over time, with lots of practice and trial and error. Understanding, valuing, and inviting facilitation can play a pivotal role in this cultural emergence. Facilitation can evolve from a role, to a function, to a mindset. A truly collaborative culture is one where everyone is facilitating everyone in myriad different ways. 

When the culture of collaboration starts to leak out of specific "collaboration" spaces, and starts to show up in every aspect of the organisation, that’s when culture change is emerging. Is the company party participatory? Does the office potluck just happen like magic? Are ideas able to emerge from anywhere, evolve through many brains and hands, and be implemented in a way better than anyone first imagined? Collaboration is not about post-it notes and check-ins, but the timbre of organisational life.

Existing Loomio:

* The theory of change of Loomio is that more groups practicing effective, inclusive decision-making can change organisational dynamics at a global scale. This shows up in everything about how the tool is designed. Ultimately, it’s about culture change through collaborative practice.

* We have observed Loomio groups experiencing the lived reality of evolving culture through using the tool. Often times, it looks like a group that already has a collaborative culture being about to scale while holding onto it, or a group that has aspirations of being participatory continuing to exists instead of imploding.

* Loomio makes a certain kind of "new normal" of collaborative practice possible, not through any complicated technology, but through making best practice of simple collaborative practice more accessible and achievable. 

Areas for Research:

* How do we tell the stories of collaborative culture change in a compelling way? The world is hungry for them. How can we see those connections between what people use Loomio for, and what they’re doing in other aspects of how they interact?

* Many, many people have aspirations to work collaboratively, but fail because they don’t know how. What is our role in helping them?

* How can we measure or visualise culture change through Loomio? Data about how a group interacts over time seems like a powerful source of learning, but we haven’t really tapped that for our own learning, or revealed their own culture change to groups.

* How do we know when culture change is actually happening? Are there tell-tale signs? Do we know what can catalyse it?
