# Navigating Loomio

You can access the most important parts of the Loomio app via the sidebar, the primary navigation menu which sits on the left-hand side of the page. The sidebar is open by default on large screens, and collapsed by default on small screens (such as smartphones). It can be toggled via the bars icon in the navigation bar.

## Viewing your threads

### Recent Threads

The **Recent Threads** page gives you an overview of the most recent activity happening in your groups. You can access this page via the **Recent** option in the sidebar. If you are a member of multiple groups the **Recent Threads** page will be your landing page when you sign into Loomio.

The **Recent Threads** page displays content from your groups in a prioritised list. Open proposals are at the top, followed by **Starred** threads, then all of the threads from your groups, sorted by most recent activity; **Today**, **Yesterday**,** This month**, **Older than a month**.

If a thread or proposal title is **bold** then new activity has taken place since you last visited. Numbers in parentheses reflect how many new comments or votes have been posted since you last visited a particular thread. Proposals will show a pie graph, with your position on the proposal superimposed on the graph. If you haven’t yet stated a position, there will be a question mark.

### Starred threads

Clicking the star icon on a thread preview marks that thread **Starred**. Use stars to mark certain threads as important. Only you can see if you’ve starred a thread.

### Unread Threads

The **Unread Threads** page shows all threads and proposals that have new content since you last visited, sorted by group. You can access this page via the **Unread** option in the sidebar. You can mark an unread thread as read and clear it from the **Unread Threads** page by hovering over the thread preview and selecting the **Mark as read** option.

### Muted

The **Muted** page displays all threads you have previously muted. It can be accessed via the **Muted** option in the sidebar. Muted threads do not appear on your **Recent** or **Unread** pages.  You can mute a thread by hovering over the thread preview on the group page, **Recent Threads** page, or **Unread Threads** page, and selecting the **Mute** option.


### Filter threads

The **Filter Threads** dropdown lets you choose to see:

* **Recent Threads:** all threads and proposals with recent activity.

* **Participating threads**: only the threads and proposals you’ve participated in.

* **Muted: **only the threads which you’ve previously [muted](keeping_up_to_date.html#thread-volume "goes to keeping up to date section of the help manual").

## Viewing your groups

All the groups you belong to are listed in the sidebar. If you are only a member of one Loomio group, the home page for this group will be your landing page when you sign into Loomio. If you have multiple groups you can easily navigate between them from using the sidebar.

## Exploring public groups
